# Agent notes — `archive`

**Owns** `src/plugins/archive/**`.

**Contract**: the `Plugin` trait, `Ctx` and the host capabilities come from the published
`rtok-plugin-sdk` crate (`crates/rtok-plugin-sdk`), not from `crate::plugin` — import them as
`rtok_plugin_sdk::…`.

**Invariants**
- Determinism: the same `tool_use_id` is rewritten to byte-identical text on every request.
  Persist the decision (id → archived, or id → expanded) in the DB before returning.
- Prefix safety: a unit test must prove the request bytes up to the first rewritten block are
  unchanged (T5.3 Check).
- Never rewrite `system`, `tools`, the last `keep_turns` turns, or an expanded id.
- One `Measurement` per rewritten block; track the expand rate — it is the honesty metric.

**Do not** summarise content with a model. Rewrite only payloads returned by `Wire::tool_results` (T11.4) and `Wire::skill_refs` (T61.2).

**Checks**: `plan/` T5.3, T5.4, T11.4.
