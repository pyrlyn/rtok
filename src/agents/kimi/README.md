# Kimi Code

`rtok agents install kimi` — Moonshot's Kimi Code CLI (`kimi`) and Kimi Code Desktop
(`Kimi Code.app`): one install writes the same two files. Two files under one key,
`[setup.kimi] config_path` (default `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`): hooks go into `config.toml`
as `[[hooks]]` tables, MCP into the sibling `mcp.json`. Edits keep the user's comments and
every hook or server that is not ours.

## Modules

| Module | Support | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hooks | yes | `[[hooks]]` with `event`, `matcher`, `command = "rtok hook <event>"`, `timeout` (seconds) on PreToolUse (Bash, Read), PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, SessionStart, PreCompact, PostCompact, SessionEnd |
| mcp | yes | `mcpServers.rtok` → `rtok mcp --host kimi` in `mcp.json`, `{command, args}` as the Kimi docs show it, no `type` (off with `[setup] mcp = false`); independent of the plugin (T275/D33): written on every install/update regardless of plugin state, only remove takes it out |
| plugin | `--yes` | install prints `/plugins install <resolved plugins/kimi path>` behind the flag — rtok never writes `plugins/managed/`, that store is Kimi's and undocumented. While the plugin is installed (`<kimi home>/plugins/managed/rtok/kimi.plugin.json` exists), setup strips rtok's own `[[hooks]]` tables instead of adding them (D21 singleton, hooks only); MCP is independent of it (T275/D33) |
| proxy | no | Kimi Code providers are [providers.<name>] tables with their own base_url and keys; setup does not edit them |

Kimi's hook protocol is Claude's: stdin `hook_event_name`, `session_id`, `cwd`, `tool_name`,
`tool_input`; exit 2 blocks with stderr as the reason; `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision`
denies. `rtok hook` runs unchanged with the default `[hook] host = "claude"`. Not in the Kimi
docs: `hookSpecificOutput.updatedInput` on PreToolUse — the command rewrite that `cmd` relies
on is unverified there, the deny path is the one the docs promise.

## rtok plugins this host reaches

Hooks carry `hook` and `cli`, MCP carries `mcp`. Nothing carries `proxy`.
