# ZCode

`rtok agents install zcode` — Z.ai's ZCode desktop app (the GLM coding harness). One config
file, `[setup.zcode] config_path`, default `~/.zcode/cli/config.json`, carries hooks and MCP.
The app starts without a shell PATH, so every command written is the absolute `rtok` binary.
The linked plugin carries hooks instead, by default (below); MCP is independent of it
(T275/D33).

## Modules

| Module | Support | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hooks | yes | `hooks.enabled = true` and `hooks.events.<Event>[]` → `<abs rtok> hook <event>` with `timeoutMs` on PreToolUse (Bash, Read), PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, SessionStart; ZCode has no PreCompact, PostCompact or SessionEnd |
| mcp | yes | `mcp.servers.rtok` → `<abs rtok> mcp --host zcode` (off with `[setup] mcp = false`); independent of the plugin (T275/D33): written on every install/update regardless of plugin state, only remove takes it out |
| proxy | no | ZCode providers are per-id tables with their own keys and base URLs; setup does not edit them |
| plugin | yes | links `plugins/zcode` (hooks only: T275/D33) to `~/.zcode/cli/plugins/local/rtok` by default, once ZCode itself is detected, and lists it in `plugins.dirs` — ZCode loads inline plugin roots from there, enabled by default; while the plugin is linked it is the only call path for hooks, so setup strips its own config-file hook entries; a stale or foreign destination is never overwritten |

ZCode's hook protocol is Claude's: stdin `session_id`, `cwd`, `hook_event_name`, `tool_name`,
`tool_input`; stdout `hookSpecificOutput`; exit 2 blocks. `rtok hook` runs unchanged with the
default `[hook] host = "claude"`. Not verified on a live install: whether ZCode names its
shell tool `Bash` — the matchers follow the docs. The app bundle path and the inline-plugin
discovery (`plugins.dirs`, enabled by default, marketplace id `inline`) were read from the
installed app (v0.2.0) and its bundled configuration guide.

The plugin (`plugins/zcode/`) wraps the same five hook entries in a launcher that resolves the
binary itself (`${ZCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/hook.sh`, fail open with the ketch hint). It ships
no MCP server of its own (T275/D33). Windows: the launcher is POSIX, so prefer the plain
install there, which writes the absolute exe.

Hooks carry `hook` and `cli`, MCP carries `mcp` and is served directly by this host's own
`config.json` (T275/D33). Nothing carries `proxy`.
