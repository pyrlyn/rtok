# Gemini CLI

`rtok agents install gemini` — Google's Gemini CLI. One config file,
`[setup.gemini] dir` (default `~/.gemini`), carries both hooks and MCP in
`settings.json`. No separate desktop app.

Headless ping (`rtok mcp ping gemini`): `gemini -p "<prompt>"`. `-p` queries
non-interactively (https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/cli-reference/, checked 2026-09-27).

## Modules

| Module | Support | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hooks | yes | `hooks.<Event>[]` → `{hooks: [{type: "command", command: "rtok hook <Event> --host gemini", timeout}]}` on BeforeTool, AfterTool, BeforeAgent, SessionStart, SessionEnd, PreCompress — no `matcher`, so every call fires (a Claude-shaped tool-name matcher would never match Gemini's own tool names) |
| mcp | yes | `mcpServers.rtok` → `rtok mcp --host gemini` in `settings.json` as `{command, args}` (off with `[setup] mcp = false`) |
| proxy | no | Gemini CLI has no documented base-URL setting; its own HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY covers MCP server transport only, not the model API |
| plugin | `--yes` | `gemini extensions link <plugins/gemini>` (T118.3); D21 — while linked, `hooks` above go instead of coming. MCP is the T275/D33 exception: `mcp` above is written into `settings.json` on every install/update regardless, alongside the extension's own `mcpServers.rtok` (Gemini's `settings.json` wins over a same-name extension server, so the two merge into one process) |

`--host gemini` (T118.1) maps Gemini's own event names to Claude's before the shared
plugins run (`BeforeTool`→`PreToolUse`, `AfterTool`→`PostToolUse`, `BeforeAgent`→
`UserPromptSubmit`, `PreCompress`→`PreCompact`, `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd` unchanged) and
shapes the reply back (`{decision: "deny", reason}` to block, `{hookSpecificOutput: …}` to
rewrite or add context). `AfterAgent`, `BeforeModel`, `BeforeToolSelection`, `AfterModel` and
`Notification` have no rtok plugin behind them and are left uninstalled. Not verified on a
live install: the `gemini` binary name and `--version` output (docs do not show either
explicitly), and whether hooks fire from a fresh install with no prior `gemini` run.
