# Cursor

`rtok agents install cursor` — the desktop app (`cursor`) and the CLI (`cursor-agent`). Both
read the same `~/.cursor` tree, so one install covers both; `--cli` / `--desktop` only pick
which app the report shows.

Files: `~/.cursor/hooks.json` (hooks) and `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (MCP).
Plugin link: `~/.cursor/plugins/local/rtok` → `plugins/cursor/` from the rtok install (D21).

Headless ping (`rtok mcp ping cursor --cli`): `cursor-agent -p "<prompt>"` (`agent -p` is the
same flag). `-p` / `--print` is non-interactive mode
(https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using, checked 2026-09-27; `agent -p` at
https://cursor.com/docs/cli/overview). `--desktop` checks `mcp.json` and prints the prompt.

## Modules

| Module | Support | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hooks | yes | `beforeShellExecution` → PreToolUse, `afterShellExecution` → PostToolUse, `preCompact` → PreCompact, `sessionEnd` → SessionEnd (T390; one table, `src/agents/hook_events.rs`); all `--host cursor`. `beforeSubmitPrompt` and `subagentStart` are not registered: their output has no context field, so nothing they return reaches the model (`research.md` §23; https://cursor.com/docs/hooks, checked 2026-10-04), and `sessionStart` registers the agent. Install and remove still take back a `beforeSubmitPrompt` entry the T390 build wrote (T390.1); in `hooks.json` only without the plugin — the linked plugin carries the same events, so setup strips ours there (T244) |
| mcp | yes | `mcpServers.rtok` → `rtok mcp --host cursor` in `mcp.json` (off with `[setup] mcp = false`); independent of the plugin (T275/D33): written on every install/update regardless of plugin state, only remove takes it out |
| plugin | yes | links `plugins/cursor` (hooks only: T275/D33) by default, once Cursor itself is detected; a stale or foreign destination is never overwritten |
| proxy | no | Cursor has no base-URL setting to point at the proxy |

## rtok plugins this host reaches

Hooks carry the `hook` and `cli` surfaces; the linked plugin serves them. MCP carries `mcp`,
served by `mcp.json` on its own. Nothing carries `proxy`.

Reachable: measure, cmd, read, json_tree, archive, inject, guard, memory, graph, toon, docs
Not reachable: proxy, compress
