# Codex

`rtok agents install codex` — the Codex CLI (`codex`).

Files: `~/.codex/config.toml` (MCP / proxy) and `~/.codex/hooks.json` (`PreCompact` / `PostCompact`).

Headless ping (`rtok mcp ping codex`): `codex exec "<prompt>"`. `codex exec` runs
non-interactively (https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference, checked 2026-09-27).

## Modules

| Module | Support | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mcp | yes | `[mcp_servers.rtok]` with `command`/`args` → `rtok mcp --host codex` (off with `[setup] mcp = false`); independent of the plugin (T275/D33): written on every install/update regardless of plugin state, only remove takes it out |
| proxy | `--proxy` | `[model_providers.rtok]` with `base_url = http://<bind>:<port>/v1` and `model_provider = "rtok"`; a replaced `model_provider` is kept as `# rtok: was "…"` on that line and restored on remove, and a `[model_providers.rtok]` the user edited stays unless `--yes` (T307) |
| hooks | yes | `hooks.json` `PreCompact` → `pre_compact`, `PostCompact` → `session_start` `source=compact` |
| plugin | yes | runs `codex plugin marketplace add pyrlyn/rtok` (skipped once Codex already knows the `rtok` marketplace) and `codex plugin add rtok@rtok` (remove: `plugin remove` + `marketplace remove`); installed by default once `codex` is on PATH — no flag needed; while it is installed it is the only call path for hooks (D21), so setup strips its own `hooks.json` there; MCP is independent of the plugin (T275/D33); a missing or failing `codex` leaves the offer open instead of failing the install; `rtok agents update` runs `codex plugin marketplace upgrade rtok` (Codex has no `plugin update`; it refreshes the installed cache too) and reinstalls plugin and marketplace only when that fails |
