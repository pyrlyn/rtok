# GitHub Copilot

`rtok agents install copilot` — GitHub Copilot CLI (`copilot`) and the GitHub Copilot desktop
app, which read one directory: `[setup.copilot] dir` (default `~/.copilot`, what
`$COPILOT_HOME` points at). Setup writes two files there: `mcp-config.json` is merged and every
other server survives; `hooks/rtok.json` is rtok's own file, since Copilot loads every
`hooks/*.json`, so no user file is touched and `remove` simply deletes it. `list` shows the CLI
and the app as one shared host, as it does for Cursor.

Headless ping (`rtok mcp ping copilot --cli`): `copilot -p "<prompt>" --allow-all-tools`.
`-p` / `--prompt` is the programmatic flag; `--allow-all-tools` lets the unattended run call
MCP (https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-cli/about-copilot-cli, checked
2026-09-27). `--desktop` checks `mcp-config.json` and prints the prompt.

## Modules

| Module | Support | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hooks | yes | `hooks/rtok.json` runs `hook <Event> --host copilot` (`bash` and `powershell`, `timeoutSec`) on preToolUse, postToolUse, userPromptSubmitted, sessionStart, sessionEnd, preCompact, subagentStart (spawn brief as `additionalContext`); each line resolves `rtok` from PATH then `~/.ketch/bin/rtok`, else fails open |
| mcp | yes | `mcpServers.rtok` → `rtok mcp --host copilot` in `mcp-config.json` as `{type: "local", command, args, tools: ["*"]}` (off with `[setup] mcp = false`) |
| proxy | no | Copilot BYOK is env-only (COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL); there is no config file to point at the proxy |
| plugin (cli) | `--yes` | install runs `copilot plugin install <resolved plugins/copilot>` behind the flag — rtok never writes `installed-plugins/`, that store is Copilot's. While the plugin is installed (a cached copy under `installed-plugins/` names `rtok`), setup takes back `hooks/rtok.json` instead of adding it (D21: the plugin is the hooks unit). `mcpServers.rtok` is independent of the plugin (T275/D33): it is written on every install/update regardless |
| plugin (desktop) | no | the GitHub Copilot app does not document plugin installs; `copilot plugin` serves the CLI |
| hooks (desktop) | no | the GitHub Copilot app does not document hooks; the shared hooks/rtok.json is written for the CLI |

Copilot's hook protocol is its own: camelCase stdin (`sessionId`, `cwd`, `toolName`,
`toolArgs`) and a flat stdout (`permissionDecision`, `permissionDecisionReason`,
`modifiedArgs`, `additionalContext`). `--host copilot` maps both ways (T46.3), so the plugins
see Claude's `Bash` and `Read` and answer in Copilot's shape. Copilot reads a non-zero exit on
preToolUse as deny; `rtok hook` keeps exiting 0 with `{}` on any error, so fail open holds.
Not verified on a live install: Copilot's tool ids (the rename to `Bash`/`Read` goes by
substring), the app bundle paths, and whether the app runs hooks at all.

The table row's resolver: `agents::hook_resolver` (bash), `agents::copilot::hook_resolver_ps`
(powershell, T250.2) — Copilot's only host with a `powershell` field, hence its own twin.

## rtok plugins this host reaches

Hooks carry `hook` and `cli`, MCP carries `mcp`. Nothing carries `proxy`. The app is
MCP-only until its hook support is documented.
