# Cline

`rtok agents install cline` — the CLI (`cline`) and the VS Code extension
(`saoudrizwan.claude-dev`). The desktop variant is detected from VS Code:
`/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app` on macOS and
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe` on Windows. Both surfaces
scan `~/Documents/Cline/Hooks`, so one directory
serves both surfaces (D21 singleton): per event the installer links
`plugins/cline/hooks/rtok-hook` as `<hooks_path>/<Event>` (a foreign file at an
event slot is left alone and named in the output — Cline has one slot per event
per directory). MCP is per surface: `mcpServers.rtok` → `rtok mcp` in
`[setup.cline] mcp_path` (default `~/.cline/data/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`,
the CLI file) and in the extension file
`<VS Code User>/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
(off with `[setup] mcp = false`).

## Modules

| Module | Support | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hooks | yes | one `plugins/cline/hooks/rtok-hook` link per event (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `TaskStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `SessionEnd`), event from the link name |
| mcp | yes | `mcpServers.rtok` → `rtok mcp --host cline` in both `cline_mcp_settings.json` files, `{command, args}` with no `type` (off with `[setup] mcp = false`) |
| plugin | `--yes` | the hook links ARE the plugin unit: no second link step, `installed()` reports `plugin` exactly when `hooks` is installed |
| proxy | no | the Anthropic base URL is extension state, not a file rtok may edit |

## rtok plugins this host reaches

Hooks carry the `hook` and `cli` surfaces, MCP carries `mcp`; the hook links are the
plugin unit, so nothing extra is linked. Nothing carries `proxy`.

Reachable: measure, cmd, read, archive, inject, guard, memory, graph, toon, docs
Not reachable: proxy, compress
