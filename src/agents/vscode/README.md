# VS Code (GitHub Copilot Chat)

GitHub Copilot agent mode in VS Code reads MCP from the user profile `mcp.json`
(`servers.<name>`, `type: "stdio"`), and hooks from a linked Agent Plugin's own
`hooks/hooks.json` once its directory is registered in `chat.pluginLocations`
(`settings.json`, an object mapping path to enabled state — JSONC, T79/T117). Stable and
Insiders each have their own profile dir (`[setup.vscode] code_user_dir` / `insiders_user_dir`;
empty means the OS default under Code / Code - Insiders).

Files: `<user-dir>/mcp.json` (MCP, independent of the plugin: T275/D33) and
`<user-dir>/settings.json` (`chat.pluginLocations`).
Plugin link: `<user-dir>/plugins/rtok` → `plugins/claude/` from the rtok install — VS Code
accepts that tree's layout (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `hooks/hooks.json`) as one of its
documented formats, so setup links it as is rather than shipping a separate `plugins/vscode/`
copy (D21). The plugin no longer carries an MCP declaration of its own (T275/D33).

## Modules

| module | support | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hooks | no | no direct hooks file rtok writes; the linked plugin's hooks/hooks.json is what VS Code's Local harness runs (chat.useClaudeHooks) |
| mcp | yes | `servers.rtok = {type: "stdio", command, args: ["mcp", "--host", "vscode"]}` in each profile `mcp.json`; independent of the plugin (T275/D33): written on every install/update regardless of plugin state, only remove takes it out |
| proxy | no | Copilot in VS Code has no documented base-URL setting to point at the proxy |
| plugin | `--yes` | registers `plugins/claude` (hooks only: T275/D33) in `chat.pluginLocations`, per profile; a stale or foreign destination is never overwritten |

MCP is the only direct path in and is independent of the plugin (T275/D33); the linked plugin
carries hooks, so the plugins that declare either surface are reachable once it is registered.

## rtok plugins this host reaches

Hooks carry the `hook` surface, MCP carries `mcp`; the linked plugin serves hooks, and MCP
is served directly by this host's own `mcp.json` (T275/D33).

Reachable (desktop): cmd, read, archive, inject, guard, memory, graph, toon
Not reachable (desktop): measure, proxy, compress

Plugin format and `chat.pluginLocations` confirmed by fetching these pages 2026-09-24 (T117):
VS Code accepts a plugin whose manifest lives at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (Claude's own
layout, matching `plugins/claude/` unchanged), and its hook event names
(`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PreCompact`,
`SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `Stop`) match rtok's.
