# Grok Build — `rtok agents install grok`

Grok Build (xAI's `grok` CLI) reads Claude-style plugin directories, so rtok's hooks install as
one plugin (`plugins/grok`, plan T99). Grok owns its plugin store — `rtok` never writes
`~/.grok/plugins/`; it prints the exact line:

```
grok plugin install <resolved plugins/grok> --trust
```

`--trust` is required: without it Grok leaves the hooks inactive. Remove with
`grok plugin uninstall rtok`. Alternative install: copy the folder to `~/.grok/plugins/rtok/`
(auto-trusted) and list `rtok` in `[plugins].enabled` in `~/.grok/config.toml`.

`rtok agents install grok` always writes `[mcp_servers.rtok]` into `~/.grok/config.toml` itself,
plugin installed or not (T275/D33: the plugin ships no MCP server of its own). The one thing
that still skips it is Grok's Claude import: Grok fires hooks from `~/.claude/settings.json`
and MCP servers from `~/.claude.json` while `[compat.claude]` `hooks`/`mcps` are on (the
default), so while rtok's Claude install already serves a capability, setup says so instead of
adding a second set — two hook sets would fire every event twice, and a second `[mcp_servers]`
table would run a second `rtok mcp` process on one store.

The Read path stays Grok's own for now: Grok's file read is `read_file`, and Grok blocks a call
whose `updatedInput` fails the tool's schema, so the `read_file` → `Read` mapping lands only
after a live payload confirms the shape (plan T100).

The plugin is macOS/Linux only: each hook resolves `rtok` from `PATH`, then
`~/.ketch/bin/rtok`, else exits 0 silently (fail open; `ketch install pyrlyn/rtok` fixes a
missing binary). Grok runs the same command through PowerShell on Windows, where that shell
one-liner does not work — Windows users should run `rtok agents install claude` instead (Grok
imports Claude's hooks, see above).

## Modules

| Module | Support | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hooks | no | Grok fires one hook set — the plugin's, or rtok's Claude hooks through [compat.claude] hooks — and setup adds no second set |
| mcp | yes | `[mcp_servers.rtok]` → `rtok mcp --host grok` in `config.toml`, Grok's documented shape; independent of the plugin (T275/D33), skipped only while `[compat.claude] mcps` already covers it (off with `[setup] mcp = false`) |
| plugin | `--yes` | install prints `grok plugin install <resolved plugins/grok> --trust` behind the flag — rtok never writes `~/.grok/plugins/`, that store is Grok's; it ships hooks only (T275/D33) |
| proxy | no | Grok Build providers live in its own settings tables; setup does not edit them |

## rtok plugins this host reaches

The plugin carries `hook`; the MCP table carries `mcp`. Nothing carries `proxy`.
