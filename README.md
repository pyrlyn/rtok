[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=listepo_rtok&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=listepo_rtok) [![Coverage](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=listepo_rtok&metric=coverage)](https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=listepo_rtok&metric=coverage) [![Tests](https://img.shields.io/sonar/tests/listepo_rtok?server=https%3A%2F%2Fsonarcloud.io&compact_message)](https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=listepo_rtok&metric=tests)

`rtok` reduces the context that AI coding agents must carry. It is one Rust binary with
three surfaces: Claude Code hooks, an MCP server, and an API proxy. Each reduction is
measured, and shortened payloads stay retrievable by id.

Ten methods, one process, one ledger. A saving that is not a row in that ledger does not
exist — including rtok's own.

## Install

macOS on Apple silicon, and Linux x86-64. The script is POSIX `sh`, so it behaves the
same whether your shell is bash or zsh; it puts `rtok` in `~/.cargo/bin`.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/pyrlyn/rtok/releases/latest/download/rtok-installer.sh | sh
```

Or with [ketch](https://github.com/pyrlyn/ketch) — it installs straight from these
GitHub Release archives, no tap or formula:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrlyn/ketch/main/install.sh | bash
ketch install pyrlyn/rtok
```

Or Homebrew (once the formula PR in [pyrlyn/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/pyrlyn/homebrew-tap)
has been merged for that release):

```bash
brew install pyrlyn/tap/rtok
```

Or from npm or PyPI, which carry the same native binary (macOS arm64, Linux x86-64 glibc,
Windows x86-64); no Node or Python code runs once it is installed. Both are published by hand,
so check the registry for the version you want ([docs/release.md](docs/release.md#npm-pypi-and-cratesio)):

```bash
npm i -g rtok-cli            # or: npx rtok-cli --help
uv tool install rtok-cli     # or: pipx install rtok-cli, uvx --from rtok-cli rtok --help
```

The package is `rtok-cli` on both registries; the command it installs is `rtok` (npm also
links `rtok-cli`).
Prefer a global install over `npx`/`uvx` before `rtok agents install`: hosts call `rtok` from
`PATH`, and a cached one-off copy can disappear.

The dist installer also gives you `rtok-update`; run it to move to the newest release.

macOS release binaries are codesigned with the Developer ID (notarisation is still off). A
browser download of a `.tar.xz` may still quarantine the file until Gatekeeper has checked it;
the installer above and `ketch install pyrlyn/rtok` do not set quarantine. Details:
[docs/release.md](docs/release.md).

Building from source works on any platform Rust supports:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyrlyn/rtok && cd rtok
mise install
mise exec -- cargo install --path .
rtok --version
```

Shell completions and the man page are generated from the same clap tree as
`--help`, so they never drift from the CLI surface:

```bash
rtok completions bash > ~/.bash_completion.d/rtok   # or zsh, fish, powershell, elvish
rtok completions clink > %LOCALAPPDATA%\clink\rtok.lua  # cmd.exe through Clink
rtok completions --install                           # to $SHELL's own directory; --uninstall undoes it
rtok completions                                     # in a terminal: pick the shells, checked = installed
rtok completions --list                              # shell, installed yes/no, file; for scripts
rtok man | man -l -                                  # or save as manpath/rtok.1
rtok man --dir ~/.local/share/man/man1               # rtok.1 plus rtok-<command>.1 for every subcommand
```

The picker lists every shell with its completions pre-checked when they are installed.
Space toggles, Enter installs the newly checked shells and removes the unchecked ones,
Esc or Ctrl-C changes nothing. Without a terminal, `rtok completions` with no shell fails
instead of waiting; use `--list` to read the state.

Release archives also carry them pre-built in `share/`: `share/man/man1/*.1` and
`share/completions/` (`rtok.bash`, `_rtok`, `rtok.fish`, `rtok.ps1`, `rtok.elv`, `rtok.lua`).

A shorter path (install → doctor → hooks) is also in
[`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md).

## Start with Claude Code

Install rtok's eight hooks and MCP entry. The installer backs up the settings file before
writing it; inspect its changes first if preferred.

```bash
rtok agents install claude --dry-run
rtok agents install claude
rtok doctor
```

`--dry-run` prints exactly what it would write and touches nothing:

```text
+ PreToolUse Bash rtok hook PreToolUse
+ PreToolUse Read rtok hook PreToolUse
+ PostToolUse * rtok hook PostToolUse
+ UserPromptSubmit rtok hook UserPromptSubmit
+ SessionStart rtok hook SessionStart
+ PreCompact rtok hook PreCompact
+ PostCompact rtok hook PostCompact
+ SessionEnd rtok hook SessionEnd
8 additions
```

Each app gets one block: kind and name (`CLI: Claude Code`, `Desktop: Cursor`),
install path and version, config files touched, and the state of every rtok
module (`hooks`, `mcp`, `proxy`, `plugin`) as `✓ installed`,
`✗ not installed (--flag)`, or `− not supported: why`. rtok's own plugins are
listed the same way from the surfaces each one declares (`(off)` when disabled).

`claude` covers both Claude Code and Claude Desktop (Desktop is MCP only, in
`claude_desktop_config.json`). A second run of the same command says
`already installed` instead of repeating a diff. `rtok agents list` prints the
same blocks without writing; `rtok doctor` lists modules for every host under
`agents`.

After upgrading rtok, `rtok agents update` refreshes every host rtok is
installed in (or only the hosts named): a hook or MCP entry written by an older
binary path or with an old timeout is rewritten in place, and a
host that has nothing of rtok is skipped rather than installed into.

Plugin versions and updates: [docs/plugin-versions.md](docs/plugin-versions.md)

`rtok agents uninstall claude` takes it all back out: hook entries, MCP
registration, and the proxy variable. Both install and uninstall copy every file
they touch to `_backup/<name>.bak-<ts>` first; a no-op run leaves no copy,
and identical content is never backed up twice. After a write, each requested
module is read back — a module that did not land is a warning, as is an
`rtok` that is not on `PATH`.

Run the proxy separately when you want provider usage rows and archive compression:

```bash
rtok proxy --mode passthrough
# In another shell, point the host at http://127.0.0.1:8790.
```

Two ways to shrink old tool results on the Anthropic wire, measured on the same
six-turn request (103 729 bytes upstream-bound; `tests/proxy.rs`
`proxy_compress_rewrites_old_tool_results_identically` and
`proxy_anthropic_context_edits_arm_platform_path`):

| path | upstream body | local rows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `archive` (`mode = "compress"`) | 70 837 B (−31.7 %) | 4 `archive` Measurements, one per rewritten block |
| platform (`[proxy] context_management = true`) | 103 798 B (+69 B field) | 1 zero-delta `proxy/context_management` row naming the path; `archive` stands down (0 rows) |

The platform's own clearing happens server-side and is not locally observable, so by
D3 no saving is claimed for it — only the added field is measured. Keep `archive`
where the platform cannot clear (the OpenAI wires); where both apply, the platform
wins and `archive` skips those turns rather than shrinking twice.

## Examples

### Price the stack you already have

`rtok doctor` reads your host's settings and reports what every installed tool costs per
turn — before you install anything of rtok's. Abridged real output:

```text
hooks 88
  PreToolUse 14
  PostToolUse 12
  SessionStart 14
  UserPromptSubmit 9
  …
mcp
  code-review-graph (30 tools, ~2295 desc tokens)
  serena (22 tools, ~1494 desc tokens)
  lean-ctx (12 tools, ~697 desc tokens)
  rtok (11 tools, ~143 desc tokens)
proxy 8788→8787
mcp_tool_search likely disabled (ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL is set)
autoCompactWindow 300000
skills (68 listed, 12963 desc bytes ≈ 3240 tokens per request)
  design-is plugin:claude-mem desc 374c body 18403B calls - WARN desc>200 WARN body>8K …
  caveman-setup user desc 1c body 10304B calls - WARN body>8K (references/) …
```

Those description tokens are re-sent on every request of every session. That is the number
most tools do not count against themselves. The skills section (2026-09-18) prices the same
listing for the host's skills: 68 listed skills ride as ≈ 3.2 K description tokens per
request, and the `WARN` flags name the bodies that should live in `references/` instead of
`SKILL.md` — measured on this machine by the T61.3 audit.

### Run a command without paying for its output

```bash
rtok run -- cargo test
```

`rtok run` executes the command through your shell, keeps the exit code, writes the raw
output to `~/.rtok/archive/<id>`, and prints a per-family summary. Anything over 40 lines
gets a trailer naming its id:

```text
[rtok 7f3a91 · 412 lines · expand: rtok expand 7f3a91]
```

Nothing is redacted, a non-zero exit prints the last 80 lines verbatim, and the original is
one command away:

```bash
rtok expand 7f3a91                    # the whole thing
rtok expand 7f3a91 --lines 120-180    # just that range
rtok expand 7f3a91 --grep "panicked"  # just the matches, as N:line (regex)
rtok expand 7f3a91 --grep "panicked" --context 3  # matches with 3 lines around each, windows merged with --
rtok expand 7f3a91 --lines 210-230    # then the lines around hit 214
```

With the hooks installed this happens on its own: `PreToolUse` rewrites the agent's Bash
call to `rtok run -- <command>`.

### Ask the code graph instead of grepping

```bash
rtok graph index .
```

```text
indexed 5 files · 551 rows · 0 skipped · 5 read
```

The agent then reaches it over MCP as `symbol`, `callers`, `impact`, `outline` and `explore` —
five tools whose descriptions cost 127 tokens, in place of a grep-and-read chain. Definition
lookups are exact (recall and precision 1.000 over a hand-labelled set); reference lookups
find about a third of the sites, which [docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md) explains
rather than hides.

### See what is on and where it runs

```bash
rtok plugins
```

```text
id       enabled  surfaces
measure  on       cli,proxy
cmd      on       hook,cli
read     on       mcp,hook
archive  on       proxy,mcp
proxy    on       proxy
inject   on       hook
guard    on       hook
memory   on       mcp,hook
graph    on       mcp
toon     on       proxy,mcp
```

Turn one off with `rtok config set plugins.cmd.enabled false`, or turn `toon` off with
`rtok config set plugins.toon.enabled false` — same thing as a `[plugins.<id>]` table in the
config file.

### Find out where a setting came from

Every flag is a config key, and every key knows its layer:

```bash
rtok config show --sources
```

```text
core.db_path = ~/.rtok/rtok.db (user)
log.level = info (user)
web.port = 3333 (user)
estimator.code = 3.5 (user)
…
```

`rtok proxy --port 8791` and `[proxy] port = 8791` are the same setting reached two ways;
`--sources` says which one won.

### Send the ledger to your observability stack

```bash
rtok otel status
```

```text
endpoint: none (set [otel] endpoint or OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT)
calls: mark 0 · 0 pending
logs: mark 0 · 0 pending
sessions: mark 0
```

Point `[otel] endpoint` at Jaeger, Grafana, SigNoz or Maple and `rtok otel flush` posts
calls, logs and metrics as OTLP/HTTP JSON — see [`docs/otel.md`](docs/otel.md).

## Measure before keeping a reduction

`rtok stats` reads transcript estimates and proxy usage. The proxy's provider-reported
usage is ground truth; transcript estimates use a fixed chars-per-token heuristic
(`[estimator]` in config) and are directional only — no calibration against a real
tokenizer has been measured yet, so treat them as a trend line, not a bound.

```bash
rtok stats --since 7d
rtok stats --save-baseline before-rtok
rtok stats --compare before-rtok
```

A fresh install has nothing to report yet, and says so rather than inventing a number:

```text
sessions 0  lines 0  malformed 0
usage input=0 cache_create=0 cache_read=0 output=0  hit=0.0%  median_context=0
```

What keeps that `hit=` high with rtok installed: [docs/prompt-cache.md](docs/prompt-cache.md).

Batch, Flex, and model routing on the proxy (pass-through vs rewrite, what is planned): [docs/batch-flex.md](docs/batch-flex.md).

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `rtok agents install claude` | install Claude Code hooks and MCP registration (`--dry-run`) |
| `rtok agents uninstall claude` | take hooks, MCP registration and proxy variable back out (`--dry-run`) |
| `rtok agents update [claude,…]` | bring every installed host (or the named ones) up to date after an rtok upgrade: stale hooks, MCP command, proxy URL and plugin links rewritten in place, the rest reinstalled (`--dry-run`) |
| `rtok agents install cursor` / `codex` / `opencode` / `kilo` / `pi` / `zcode` / `kimi` / `copilot` / `aider --proxy` / `windsurf` / `zed` / `vscode` | register the other supported host integrations |
| `rtok hook <event>` | hook entry point (JSON on stdin, JSON on stdout) |
| `rtok mcp` | serve read, memory, graph, and expansion tools over stdio |
| `rtok mcp -- <server argv>` | wrap a foreign stdio MCP server: long `tools/call` text blocks are archived and cut by the `[mcp]` rule, everything else passes byte-for-byte, `rtok expand <id>` returns the raw block |
| `rtok proxy` | capture API usage; optionally archive older tool results |
| `rtok web` | local React UI (embedded in the binary) + WebSocket API at `http://127.0.0.1:3333` (default `[web] host`/`port`; `--host`, `--port`; `rtok dashboard` is the deprecated spelling). Open it as `127.0.0.1`/`localhost`: `/ws` refuses cross-site and DNS-name origins |
| `rtok stats` | report transcript and proxy measurements |
| `rtok agents usage` | tokens and estimated cost per agent and month or day, from the agents' own session files (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Kilo, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, pi, Kimi Code; Droid, Grok, ZCode and Antigravity are listed as unsupported) or what passed through rtok (`--tz`, `--since`, `--daily`, `--unpriced`, `--json`) |
| `rtok bench` | run the fixed A/B schedule |
| `rtok doctor` | inspect hooks, MCP servers and the proxy chain |
| `rtok worktree add <task-id> [<slug>] [--owner "<provider> / <model>"] [--agent <id>]` | create the task's worktree at `<root>/<repo>-<task-id>` on branch `<task-id>[-<slug>]` from a freshly fetched `origin/<default>`, locked with `<owner> \| <task-id> \| <date>[ \| agent <uuid>]`, no upstream; prints the path; binds it to the calling rtok agent (`--agent`, else `RTOK_AGENT_ID`) in the lock and the store, and `--owner` then defaults to `<host> / <model>`; refuses a second worktree for the same task or a root under a temp directory; the root is `[worktree] root`, `~/.rtok/worktrees` by default; `[worktree] enabled = false` turns every `rtok worktree` command into an error |
| `rtok worktree claim <path> [--agent <id>] [--owner <owner>]` | bind an existing worktree to the calling agent: rewrites its lock as v2 only when it has none or the lock is already the caller's (same agent, or an old lock naming `--owner`); never takes another owner's worktree |
| `rtok worktree adopt [<path>] [--task <id>] [--agent <id>] [--owner <owner>] [--json]` | bind the worktree you are in (made by a host's own tool: Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, Devin, Claude, Kilo, Conductor) to the calling agent; the task is `--task`, else the lock's, else the branch's first `-` segment; a worktree in a pool its host evicts (Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, Devin) is claimed in the store only, any other gets the v2 lock like `claim`; never takes another owner's worktree |
| `rtok worktree remove <path\|task-id> [--agent <id>] [--owner <owner>] [--keep-branch] [--json]` | remove the caller's own worktree: unlock, `git worktree remove` (never `--force`), delete the local branch when merged (squash-aware, against a freshly fetched base), release the claim, and print the `git push origin --delete` hint when a remote branch is left; refuses (exit 1) a worktree with uncommitted or untracked files, one locked by another owner or agent, and the one the command runs from; an unmerged branch is refused unless `--keep-branch`, which keeps it |
| `rtok worktree list` | every git worktree of the repository with its owner (the lock reason), bound agent (short id + host) and its state (`live` / `idle` / `ended`), else the newest session the hooks saw working there (`seen <host> <id8>`), state, origin (`main`, `cursor`, `codex`, `windsurf`, `claude`, `kilo`, `conductor` or `other`, from where it lives), source bytes and tagged build-cache bytes, plus orphans git no longer lists (`--json` with full agent ids); read-only |
| `rtok worktree whoami [--json]` | what to know before worktree work: your rtok agent (`RTOK_AGENT_ID`), the `[worktree] root` new worktrees go to, the linked worktree the cwd is in, and the worktrees of this repository bound to you (lock or claim); no size scans; read-only |
| `rtok worktree gc [--yes] [--owner <owner>] [--idle 24h]` | dry run by default; removes worktrees that are merged (squash-aware), clean and idle, deletes their local branch, and drops the record of a worktree whose directory was deleted by hand; a lock naming anyone but `--owner` is a hard stop, and so is a lock bound to a live rtok agent; nothing is forced |
| `rtok worktree clean [<path>…] [--yes] [--idle 24h]` | dry run by default; deletes build caches that carry a valid `CACHEDIR.TAG` and were idle for `--idle`, keeps the worktree and every untagged file; the worktree the command runs from is cleaned only when named; the one deletion `expand` cannot undo — a tagged cache holds no source and the next build recreates it |
| `rtok run -- <cmd>` | run, archive, and format a command result |
| `rtok filter --stdin` | filter a payload without executing it (OpenCode) |
| `rtok expand <id>` | retrieve an archived original (`--lines`, `--grep`) |
| `rtok plugins` | list plugins: id, enabled, surfaces |
| `rtok config show --sources` | show effective configuration and its source |
| `rtok graph index [path]` | build the symbol index for a tree |
| `rtok graph projects` | list the registered projects with their index status (`add`, `select`, `remove`, `link` and `unlink` change the registry) |
| `rtok memory import <file>` | import notes as JSONL |
| `rtok memory export [--project <name>]` | print notes as the JSONL `import` reads; session checkpoints stay behind |
| `rtok memory retire <id> [--superseded-by <id>]` | tombstone a note: never recalled or searched, body kept |
| `rtok memory pin / unpin <id>` | keep a note at the head of SessionStart recall, or drop it back |
| `rtok memory revise <id> --title <t> --body <b>` | save a replacement note and retire the old one |
| `rtok otel flush` / `status` | export the ledgers over OTLP, or report the watermarks |

Agent ids, messages between agents and how worktrees bind to them on every host: [docs/agents-and-worktrees.md](docs/agents-and-worktrees.md).

## Plugins

| Plugin | Surface | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `measure` | stats, bench, proxy | records before/after tokens and provider usage |
| `cmd` | PreToolUse Bash | wraps commands, formats output, and archives originals |
| `read` | MCP, PreToolUse Read | provides bounded reads, searches, trees, and re-read deduplication |
| `archive` | proxy, expand | replaces eligible old tool results with stable archive pointers |
| `proxy` | API proxy | passes traffic through and captures usage |
| `inject` | SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit | emits byte-stable context within a token budget |
| `guard` | PreToolUse | prevents repeated reads and commands within a turn window |
| `memory` | MCP, PreCompact | stores agent-written notes with progressive disclosure; FTS5 plant-and-recall 20/20 (`research.md` §14) |
| `graph` | MCP | indexes symbols and references with bounded responses |
| `toon` | proxy, MCP | encodes old tabular JSON tool results when that is smaller; on by default |

Plugin details and configuration live in [`docs/config.md`](docs/config.md),
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md), and each `src/plugins/<id>/README.md`. Every call rtok
records can be exported as OpenTelemetry traces, logs and metrics to Jaeger, Grafana, SigNoz or
Maple — see [`docs/otel.md`](docs/otel.md).

## How it compares

Ten tools that each shrink one slice of the context, stacked on one machine, produce a stack
nobody measures end to end. The author's machine before rtok: 88 hook entries, nine MCP
servers, ~8 600 tool-description tokens on every turn, two chained proxies — and every one of
those tools reported a saving while the bill did not move.

| | The field | rtok |
|---|---|---|
| Processes per tool call | up to ~30 subprocesses, several Python | one Rust process, p95 8.25 ms (research.md §2, Gate P17 serialized run 2026-09-09) |
| Hook entries | 88 across 16 events | 8 across 7 events |
| MCP description tokens/turn | ~8 600 across nine servers | ~143 across 11 tools |
| Injection per turn | 3.1 K and up, per tool | one 800-token budget, byte-stable |
| Reversibility | partial | every rewrite has `rtok expand <id>` |
| Measurement | five meters, none of them the bill | one ledger + provider `usage` |
| Failure mode | varies | fail open: exit 0, unmodified input, ≤ 10 ms |

The other side of it: rtok has no live end-to-end cost win yet, its reference lookups find
0.351 of the sites where serena's LSP finds all of them, and it has no LLM compression or
embeddings. Tool-by-tool detail, evidence for every number, and the cases where you should
use something else: **[docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md)**.

## Measured results

The committed T9.2 A/B harness schedules six tasks × three runs. Its first run was offline
(`RTOK_BENCH_LIVE` was unset), so both configurations have zero provider usage and equal
task checks. This is a reproducible baseline, **not** evidence of a bill reduction; rerun it
with live traffic before adopting a configuration.

| config | mean input | mean cache | mean output | mean cost USD | passed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| A — legacy baseline | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0000 | 6/6 |
| B — rtok | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0000 | 6/6 |
| delta (B − A) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0000 | 0 |

Sources: [`bench/results/a.json`](bench/results/a.json),
[`bench/results/b.json`](bench/results/b.json), and [`research.md`](research.md).

## Guarantees and caveats

- Hooks fail open: errors return unmodified input and exit successfully.
- Archive and proxy reductions are lossless: `rtok expand <id>` retrieves the original
  payload. A regenerable command result may instead be re-run.
- A token saving only counts when a `Measurement` row records it.
- Proxy compression preserves the cached prefix and never rewrites system instructions,
  tool definitions, or the newest tool-result turns.
- Estimates are a heuristic (chars per token) until matched with provider usage; no accuracy
  figure is measured yet. No live A/B cost reduction has been established yet.

## Development

```bash
just check
just example
just readme-check
just dist-plan
```

`just check` is the gate. While iterating, `just test-changed` builds and runs only the test
targets the current diff can reach, which is what makes the loop short: each file under
`tests/*.rs` is its own integration-test binary, and cargo links every selected one before
any test runs. The unit-test
binary is trimmed the same way, which keeps the slow TUI tests out of an unrelated edit. It
picks targets by name, so it can miss a test that exercises a module without naming it — run
`just check` before committing.

Packaging for npm, PyPI and crates.io is manual and local; no workflow publishes. Build and
try the npm package for this machine without touching a registry:

```bash
just npm-build                                   # target/npm/dist/rtok-cli-*.tgz
tmp=$(mktemp -d) && cd "$tmp" && npm init -y >/dev/null
npm i <repo>/target/npm/dist/rtok-cli-*.tgz      # rtok-cli + the platform tarball
npx rtok --version
```

`just pypi-build` does the same for a wheel (`uv venv && uv pip install target/pypi/dist/*.whl`),
and every `*-publish` recipe takes `--dry-run`. The full steps are in
[docs/release.md](docs/release.md#npm-pypi-and-cratesio).

The README smoke examples below are executed by `just readme-check`.

```bash
# check
tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
trap 'rm -rf "$tmp"' EXIT
rtok() {
  RTOK_HOME="$tmp/home" \
  RTOK_STATS_TRANSCRIPTS_DIR="$tmp/transcripts" \
  RTOK_SETUP_CLAUDE_SETTINGS_PATH="$tmp/settings.json" \
  mise exec -- cargo run -q -- "$@"
}
rtok --version
rtok config init
rtok config validate
rtok agents install claude --dry-run
rtok stats --since 1h
rtok plugins
rtok proxy --dry-run
rtok otel status
```

Read [`plan.md`](plan.md) for the current implementation plan, [`done.md`](done.md) for
completed tasks, and [`docs/plugin-authoring.md`](docs/plugin-authoring.md) to build an
external plugin.
