# Agents and worktrees

Every agent session that works through rtok gets one **rtok agent id**, and every worktree is bound to the agent that owns it, the same way on every host. Agents and the user can message each other by that id. This page is the user-facing description (decision D34); the per-host install tables are in [agents.md](agents.md) and the config keys are in [config.md](config.md).

## The agent id

- The id is a random UUIDv4 rtok issues itself, shown as its first 8 characters and accepted anywhere as any unique prefix of 4 or more. Host session ids are not unique across hosts and several hosts have none, so they are never used as the id.
- **Hooks** register the agent on the first event of a session and touch it on every later one (`SessionStart`, tool calls, `SessionEnd`). A host whose install carries hooks needs nothing else.
- **MCP** serves a host without hooks. `rtok mcp --host <host>` links itself to the session's agent by the host's own session id where the host puts one in the environment (Grok Build: `GROK_SESSION_ID`), else by the one live agent of that host in the same directory that has been seen since the process started. Two candidates bind nothing, so a message never lands with the wrong agent. A host that can carry neither hooks nor a session id gets a row of its own, registered by the MCP process.
- The agent always comes from the session. No tool takes an agent or owner argument, so a model cannot claim a worktree or send a message in another agent's name.
- `rtok agents whoami` prints the id (`RTOK_AGENT_ID`, set by the Claude Code hook into the session environment and quoted in the session-start context line; when that is missing, as in Claude's desktop app, the agent of `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`); MCP `whoami` returns it with how it was linked.

## See and talk to agents

| Command | MCP tool | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rtok agents sessions [--all]` | `agents_list` | every agent with host, state (`live`, `idle`, `ended`), activity, status, claimed worktrees and unread count; `--all` adds ended ones |
| `rtok agents show <id>` | `agent_show` | one agent: host, model, ids, parent and sub-agents, cwd, claimed worktrees, status, unread |
| `rtok agents status <text>` | `agent_status_set` | what this agent is busy with (at most 120 characters); an empty text clears it |
| `rtok agents send <id> <text>` | `agent_send` | a message to one live agent (size-capped); `--all-live` sends to every live agent of the sender's project |
| `rtok agents inbox [<id>]` | `agent_inbox` | your own messages, oldest first, marked read; with an id, that agent's queue, marking nothing |

`[agents] idle` (default 30 minutes) decides who is live. `[agents] enabled = false` stops registration and the push.

### Messages

- A hook host gets new messages **pushed** into the next prompt or tool result, framed and within `[agents] push_bytes`; the rest is announced as `… and N more`, to be read with `agent_inbox`. Every other host **pulls**: the session-start line says to call `agent_inbox`, and the MCP tool or `rtok agents inbox` reads them.
- Security: a message body is text from another agent or a person, never an instruction. Each one arrives inside a fixed frame that names the sender's id, control characters are stripped, the size is capped, and no tool argument can name the sender. Treat it as information.

## Worktrees

Raw `git worktree` records no owner, age or size. `rtok worktree` gives each worktree one location, one name, one owner and one agent:

| Command | MCP tool | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rtok worktree add <task> [<slug>]` | `worktree_add` | creates `<root>/<repo>-<task>` on branch `<task>[-<slug>]` from a fresh `origin/<default>`, locked as `<owner> \| <task> \| <date> \| agent <uuid>`, and records the claim |
| `rtok worktree adopt [<path>] [--task <id>]` | `worktree_adopt` | binds a worktree the host made to the calling agent; the directory stays where the host put it |
| `rtok worktree claim <path>` | — | the same for an existing worktree you name; rewrites its lock only when it has none or is already yours |
| `rtok worktree list` | `worktree_list` | every worktree of the repository with owner, bound agent and its state, `origin`, size; plus orphans git no longer lists |
| `rtok worktree remove <path\|task>` | `worktree_remove` | removes your own clean worktree and its merged branch; refuses a dirty one, an unmerged branch, the one you stand in, and someone else's lock unless the task is finished (merged, clean, with commits of its own); never forces |
| `rtok worktree gc`, `clean` | — | sweep finished worktrees, delete idle build caches; dry runs until `--yes`; a live agent's worktree is kept, unless its task is finished and idle past `--idle`, which opens any lock too; someone else's lock on a merged, clean worktree untouched for `--stale-lock` (`7d`) counts as abandoned |

The owner is `<host> / <model>` of the agent unless a CLI call passes `--owner`; an MCP call never does. The root is `[worktree] root`, `~/.rtok/worktrees` by default. With `[worktree] enabled = false` rtok leaves worktrees alone: every `rtok worktree` command (`list` too) says they are not enabled, MCP lists no `worktree_*` tool, and Claude's `WorktreeCreate`/`WorktreeRemove` hooks do what Claude does without rtok.

### Worktrees a host makes itself

A host that creates worktrees in its own pool (Cursor, Codex, Windsurf and Devin, Kilo, Claude Code, Conductor) leaves rtok no say in where. Run `worktree_adopt` (or `rtok worktree adopt`) inside it: rtok derives the `origin` from the path, takes the task from `--task`, else the old lock, else the branch, and binds it.

- Cursor, Codex and Windsurf/Devin delete worktrees themselves to stay under a cap (about 25, 15 and 20). Whether a git lock survives that is not confirmed, so adopting there records the claim in rtok's store only and writes no lock.
- Every other origin gets the same v2 lock as `worktree_add`.
- A worktree locked by someone else is never taken.
- Running `adopt` from a post-create script of the host (Cursor `.cursor/worktrees.json`, Kilo `.kilo/setup-script`, Windsurf and Devin `post_setup_worktree`) is **pending T289.3**. Until then the agent adopts through the skill below.

The `rtok-worktrees` skill tells the agent all of this: use `worktree_add` for new work, `worktree_adopt` for a worktree the host made, `worktree_remove` when merged.

## Per host

*Hooks* is whether a plain `rtok agents install` carries hooks (agent row and message push); a host without them registers through MCP. Native-worktree facts and sources are in `research.md` §26.

| Host | Hooks | Agent row from | Native worktrees | Adopting a host-made worktree |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | yes | hooks | `.claude/worktrees/<name>`; `WorktreeCreate`/`WorktreeRemove` can replace the default (rtok redirect pending T159) | `worktree_adopt` |
| `cursor` | yes | hooks | `~/.cursor/worktrees/`, cap 25 | `worktree_adopt`; post-create script: pending T289.3 |
| `codex` | yes | hooks | `$CODEX_HOME/worktrees`, keeps 15 | `worktree_adopt` |
| `windsurf` | no | MCP | `~/.windsurf/worktrees/<repo>`, cap about 20 | `worktree_adopt`; post-create script: pending T289.3 |
| `devin` | yes | hooks | shares Windsurf's pool | `worktree_adopt`; post-create script: pending T289.3 |
| `kilo` | no | MCP | `.kilo/worktrees/` | `worktree_adopt`; post-create script: pending T289.3 |
| `grok` | no | MCP (`GROK_SESSION_ID`) | `--parallel` sub-agent worktrees, path unverified | `worktree_adopt` |
| `mimo` | no | MCP | `auto_worktree` and orchestrator mode | `worktree_adopt` |
| `omp` | no | MCP | per-task isolation | `worktree_adopt` |
| `antigravity` | no | none (no hooks, no MCP entry) | per-conversation mode, path unverified | CLI `rtok worktree adopt` |
| `opencode` | no | MCP | none built in | `worktree_add` |
| `pi` | no | none (no hooks, no MCP entry) | none in core | CLI only |
| `zcode` | yes | hooks | none found | `worktree_add` |
| `kimi` | yes | hooks | none documented | `worktree_add` |
| `copilot` | yes | hooks | none documented for this surface | `worktree_add` |
| `vscode` | no | MCP | separate Agents-window feature, path unverified | `worktree_adopt` |
| `commandcode` | yes | hooks | none documented | `worktree_add` |
| `gemini` | yes | hooks | none found | `worktree_add` |
| `cline` | yes | hooks | none (checkpoints, not worktrees) | `worktree_add` |
| `roo` | no | MCP | not checked yet | `worktree_add` |
| `qwen` | yes | hooks | not checked yet | `worktree_add` |
| `codewhale` | yes | hooks | none documented | `worktree_add` |
| `aider` | no | none | none | CLI only |
| `zed` | no | MCP | threads can point at a worktree you make | `worktree_adopt` |

Every host can create worktrees with `worktree_add` (MCP) or `rtok worktree add` (CLI); a host with no agent row passes `--owner` on the CLI. A worktree whose path matches none of the pools above is listed with origin `other` and adopted the same way.

### Windows

On Windows rtok cannot read a process's parent pid (`rtok-sys::parent_pid` returns nothing; the Windows snapshot value is not updated after the parent exits), so no ancestor chain is read and only the cwd rule decides which agent a hook call belongs to. No host doc records this limit. Sources and dates are in `research.md` §26.

### Claude desktop app

In the desktop app's Code tab, rtok's MCP tools are served by the one `rtok mcp` the app starts from `claude_desktop_config.json` for every session, not by a process of the session itself. That process sits under no session and in no session's directory, so MCP `whoami`, `worktree_*` and `agent_*` cannot tell which agent called them and answer "not linked to an agent session" with that reason. Use `rtok agents` and `rtok worktree` from the agent's shell there. Keeping the shared entry from hiding the session's own server is T456.
