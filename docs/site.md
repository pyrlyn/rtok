## Overview

`rtok` reduces the context that AI coding agents must carry. It is one Rust binary with three
surfaces: Claude Code hooks, an MCP server, and an API proxy. Each reduction is measured, and
shortened payloads stay retrievable by id.

Ten methods, one process, one ledger. A saving that is not a row in that ledger does not exist —
including rtok's own.

## Features

- **Hooks for coding agents.** `rtok agents install claude` writes rtok's hooks and MCP entry
  into Claude Code, backing up the settings file first; `--dry-run` prints the diff and touches
  nothing. Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, pi, Kimi, Copilot, Aider, Windsurf, Zed, VS Code and more
  are registered the same way.
- **Run commands without paying for their output.** `rtok run -- <cmd>` keeps the exit code,
  archives the raw output and prints a compact summary with an id to expand it.
- **Lossless by design.** Archived payloads come back with `rtok expand <id>`, whole or by line
  range or regex match. Hooks fail open: on any error the agent gets its input unmodified.
- **Code graph over MCP.** `rtok graph index .` builds a symbol index that agents query as
  `symbol`, `callers`, `impact`, `outline` and `explore` instead of a grep-and-read chain.
- **Local API proxy.** `rtok proxy` captures provider-reported usage and can replace old tool
  results with stable archive pointers while preserving the cached prefix.
- **Measure before you keep a reduction.** `rtok stats` reads transcripts and proxy usage;
  `rtok doctor` prices the hooks, MCP servers and skills you already run.
- **Pluggable methods.** `measure`, `cmd`, `read`, `archive`, `proxy`, `inject`, `guard`,
  `memory`, `graph` and `toon` — each can be switched off in the one config file.
- **Observability.** `rtok otel flush` exports calls, logs and metrics as OTLP/HTTP JSON to
  Jaeger, Grafana, SigNoz or Maple. `rtok web` and `rtok tui` show the same data locally.

## Install

macOS (Apple silicon or Intel) and Linux x86-64, installed into `~/.cargo/bin`:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/pyrlyn/rtok/releases/latest/download/rtok-installer.sh | sh
```

With [ketch](https://github.com/pyrlyn/ketch), straight from the GitHub Release archives:

```bash
ketch install pyrlyn/rtok
```

Homebrew, npm or PyPI (the packages carry the same native binary):

```bash
brew install pyrlyn/tap/rtok
npm i -g rtok-cli
uv tool install rtok-cli
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyrlyn/rtok && cd rtok
mise install
mise exec -- cargo install --path .
rtok --version
```

## Usage examples

Install the Claude Code integration, preview first, then check it:

```bash
rtok agents install claude --dry-run
rtok agents install claude
rtok doctor
```

Run a command through rtok and read the archived output back later:

```bash
rtok run -- cargo test
rtok expand 7f3a91 --lines 120-180
rtok expand 7f3a91 --grep "panicked" --context 3
```

Index a tree for the code graph and list the plugins:

```bash
rtok graph index .
rtok plugins
rtok config set plugins.toon.enabled false
```

Run the proxy and measure:

```bash
rtok proxy --mode passthrough
rtok stats --since 7d
rtok stats --save-baseline before-rtok
rtok stats --compare before-rtok
```

See where every setting came from:

```bash
rtok config show --sources
```
