# Developing rtok on Windows

What behaves differently from the CI contract when `just check` runs on a
Windows machine, and what to do about each. Found 2026-09-26 running the full
gate locally on Windows for the first time (T272–T274).

## The Windows CI job runs tests only

`ci.yml`'s `windows` matrix runs `cargo nextest run --workspace` (in two
shards); `fmt`, `clippy`, `dup`, `js` and `python` live on the Linux jobs.
A local `just check` on Windows is therefore stricter than what CI proves
about Windows, and it surfaces Windows-only lint debt that the Linux lint
jobs cannot see — code behind `#[cfg(windows)]` or `#[cfg(unix)]` is only
analyzed on the OS that compiles it in. T273 (`permissions_set_readonly_false`
in the `cfg(windows)` `clear_readonly`) and T274 (unix-shaped test code:
early-return bodies, unix-gated helpers) were exactly that class. If clippy
fails on Windows over code CI never lints this way, fix it — do not
`--allow` the recipe.

## Line endings: match the CI checkout

Git for Windows defaults to `core.autocrlf=true`, which checks the tree out
with CRLF. Golden tests compare against fixture bytes (`tests/cmd_golden/*.in`)
and fail on a CRLF tree — `apt.in` produced `ok 0\r\n` where `ok 0\n` was
expected. CI runners check out LF. Align the tree:

```bash
git config core.autocrlf false
git rm --cached -r . && git reset --hard HEAD
```

The repo content is LF; this only rewrites the working tree to what CI sees.

## dart on PATH makes one test run — and fail

`graph_lsp_gate::lsp_backend_outlines_dart_main` skips when `dart` is not on
PATH, so CI never runs it. On a machine with the Dart SDK installed it runs,
and on Windows dart 3.9 the analysis server answers
`File is not being analyzed` for the freshly written temp project — the
outline call fails before the assertions. Until that is fixed (roadmap,
Windows developer experience), exclude it locally:

```bash
mise exec -- cargo nextest run --workspace -E 'not test(lsp_backend_outlines_dart_main)'
```

## Antivirus warms up slowly to fresh binaries

After a tree-wide rebuild (which is what the CRLF realignment above triggers)
Defender deep-scans every freshly written `rtok.exe`/test binary on first
spawn. The `agents_install` tests spawn the binary many times and can hit
nextest's 181 s `terminate-after` while cold — the same tests pass on the
warm rerun. If two integration tests time out right after a big rebuild,
rerun before investigating; excluding `target\` from real-time scanning
removes the effect entirely (a machine-level decision, not a repo one).

## Finding installed agents

`rtok agents list` treats a host as installed when its app bundle exists or its
binary is on `PATH`. On Windows that lookup follows `PATHEXT` (`.COM`, `.EXE`,
`.BAT`, `.CMD`, and whatever else the variable lists), not only `.exe`. A bare
name such as `cursor` therefore matches `cursor.cmd`, which is how the Cursor
and VS Code user installers put their CLIs on `PATH`.

An app path with no extension is the same file as `name.exe` beside it.
`~/.grok/bin/grok` is the install when the file on disk is `grok.exe`.

`--version` for a bare name or a `.cmd`/`.bat` runs through `cmd /C`.
`CreateProcess` only appends `.exe` and cannot start a batch shim, so a direct
spawn reports the agent as present with an unknown version.

Two Windows locations that are not the macOS bundle:

- OpenCode Desktop: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\@opencode-aidesktop\OpenCode.exe`
  (the older `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\OpenCode\OpenCode.exe` is still accepted).
- Cline's desktop variant is VS Code:
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe`.

The home-directory limit used while tests run (`RTOK_HOST_SANDBOX`) compares
`PATH` entries case-insensitively, so `c:\Users\…` and `C:\Users\…` are one
directory.

## Paths

`std::fs::canonicalize` on Windows returns a `\\?\` path. Comparisons against
a `C:\…` path, and ASCII case (`C:\Users` vs `c:\users`), then fail even though
the filesystem is one directory. rtok's path identity goes through `src/fs.rs`
(`canon`, `path_starts_with`, `same_path`, `strip_prefix`): `dunce` drops the
verbatim prefix when the path does not need it, and on Windows the component
check ignores ASCII case. Worktree identity, the read/search root guard and
"do not index `$HOME`" all use that helper.

## Toolchain

Everything comes through mise; `pipx:pytest` resolves on Windows only with
`uv` present (pinned in `mise.toml` — the pipx backend has no Windows build
in the mise registry). Run cargo as `mise exec -- cargo <cmd>`, never a
system toolchain (CONTRIBUTING.md).
