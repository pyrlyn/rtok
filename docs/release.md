# Releasing rtok

Two things live in this document: how a release runs today, and how Apple codesigning (on) and
notarisation (still off) fit into it. See [Status](#status-in-this-repository) for what is wired
up in this repository right now.

## The release as it runs today

Actions → **Bump and release** → *Run workflow*. No version is typed anywhere:
[`tools/release.sh`](../tools/release.sh) releases the version in `Cargo.toml`, and raises it only
when that version is already tagged. So the first run publishes `0.0.1`, the next `0.0.2`, and so
on. `level` (`patch` by default) chooses which part moves when a raise is due. The workflow has
no dry run: every run of it ships, so a green run always means a release.

The same script runs locally, and the preview lives only here — it prints the version that would
be released and writes nothing:

```bash
just release
tools/release.sh patch --dry-run
```

It lands one `release: v<version>` commit — `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `CHANGELOG.md` and every
plugin version file ([Plugin versions: Releasing](plugin-versions.md#releasing)) — pushes it, and
dispatches the dist **Release** workflow, which builds three targets, creates the tag and the
GitHub Release with the shell installer.

**Or merge the release PR** (T18.5). On every push to `main`, `.github/workflows/release-plz.yml`
runs [release-plz](https://release-plz.dev) with [`release-plz.toml`](../release-plz.toml): it keeps
one pull request titled `release: v<version>` open with the next version in `Cargo.toml` and the
`CHANGELOG.md` section for it (same `cliff.toml` groups as `just changelog`). Merging the PR (merge
commit or squash, so the title is in the commit message — GitHub appends ` (#123)` when squashing,
which the trigger allows for) runs `tools/release.sh patch --no-bump`, which dispatches **Release**
for the version now in `Cargo.toml` and refuses to raise it. release-plz creates neither the tag
nor the GitHub Release: dist does both. Both entry points end in the same script and the same
workflow, so they cannot disagree on the version.

**The release pull request cannot raise the version, and will not after v0.0.1** (measured
2026-09-09, release-plz 0.3.163). release-plz decides whether a version has shipped by comparing
the packaged crate against the copy in the registry. With `publish = false` there is no copy —
`Package rtok@*.*.* not found` — so it reads the package as never released and answers `next
version is 0.0.1` every time, whatever is in the history. Reproduced in a clean clone with the
`v0.0.1` tag fetched and `git describe` finding it, and it does not move with
`git_tag_enable = true`, with an explicit `git_tag_name = "v{{ version }}"` (ketch's setting), or
with a conventional `fix:` commit after the tag. `../ketch` is configured the same way — its own
config comment says it ships a tarball, not a crate — so it should meet this at its second release.
Untested there: it is still on `v0.1.0`.

Nothing mis-releases as a result: merging a stale release pull request runs
`tools/release.sh patch --no-bump`, which sees the version is already tagged and exits 0 without
dispatching. But the pull request proposes a version that is already out, so **use
Actions → Bump and release for the second and later releases** — `tools/release.sh` reads the tags
itself and raises the version correctly. Whether release-plz is worth keeping as a changelog
preview is a decision, not a defect to patch around.

`RELEASE_PLZ_TOKEN` (fine-grained PAT, contents and pull requests write) is required, not optional.
GitHub starts no workflow from a `GITHUB_TOKEN` event, so a release PR opened with the default
token has an empty checks list rather than a red one, and merges having never run `ci.yml`. The
`release-pr` job checks for the secret first and fails with that explanation (T18.6).

Whichever entry point starts it, the release waits on
[`verify.yml`](../.github/workflows/verify.yml) — `just check` and `just example` on Linux and
macOS, the `ci.yml` matrix — and dispatches **Release** only if it is green (T18.6). A red gate
means no dispatch, no tag and nothing on the releases page. The gate cannot live inside
`release.yml`: dist runs `host` when `build-local-artifacts` is `skipped`, which is what a failed
`plan-jobs` entry leaves behind, so it would publish a Release with no assets — the one thing the
installer and `rtok-update` both read.

| Target | Runner | Archive |
|---|---|---|
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` | `macos-14` | `rtok-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz` |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `ubuntu-22.04` | `rtok-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz` |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | `windows-latest` | `rtok-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` |

Intel macOS (`x86_64-apple-darwin`) is intentionally omitted: GitHub's
`macos-15-intel` runners queue and usually dominate release wall-clock. Release
jobs install Rust from the `rust` pin in `mise.toml` (via `jdx/mise-action`, the same
toolchain ci.yml tests), add the matrix targets to it, and restore a Cargo cache via
[`.github/build-setup.yml`](../.github/build-setup.yml).

Each build job prints archive sizes into the Actions step summary; the GitHub
Release notes get a **Download sizes** table (MiB) so you do not have to open Assets.

Plus `rtok-installer.sh`, a `rtok-<target>-update` self-updater per target, and
`sha256` sums. `.github/workflows/release.yml` is generated by `dist generate` and then patched
by [`tools/dist-generate.sh`](../tools/dist-generate.sh) — **never hand-edit it**; change
`dist-workspace.toml` or [`.github/build-setup.yml`](../.github/build-setup.yml) and run
`just dist-generate`.

### Homebrew

dist builds `rtok.rb` as a Release asset (`installers` includes `homebrew`, `tap =
"pyrlyn/homebrew-tap"`). It does **not** push to the tap: `publish-jobs` must stay without
`"homebrew"`, so there is no `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` on this repository and no
`publish-homebrew-formula` job in `release.yml`.

[`pyrlyn/homebrew-tap`](https://github.com/pyrlyn/homebrew-tap) pulls that asset itself.
`.github/workflows/sync-rtok.yml` there (schedule + `workflow_dispatch`) downloads the latest
`rtok.rb` from this repo's Releases and opens a pull request with the tap's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
Merge the PR to publish:

```bash
brew install pyrlyn/tap/rtok
```

ketch's cask lives under `Casks/` in the same tap and is unrelated; Formula and Casks do not
collide. Do not add `publish-jobs = ["homebrew"]` here — dist would demand `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`
and push straight to `main` of the tap, which is deliberately not how this project updates
Homebrew.


## npm, PyPI and crates.io

All three are **manual**: a person runs the scripts below from a clean checkout of the release
commit. No workflow publishes to any of them, and none should without a separate decision
(`release-plz.yml` does not publish to crates.io either: `release-plz.toml` sets
`publish = false` and the workflow only runs `release-pr` and dispatches dist). Publish after
dist has finished the GitHub Release, because npm packs its binaries from that Release.

Every script refuses to run when versions disagree with the `rtok` version in `Cargo.toml`, and
every one takes `--dry-run`.

### npm (`rtok-cli`)

The esbuild/biome layout. `rtok-cli` holds a small Node launcher (`npm/rtok-cli/bin/rtok`, linked
as both `rtok` and `rtok-cli`) and lists one
package per dist target in `optionalDependencies`; npm installs only the one whose `os`/`cpu`
(and `libc`) match:

| Package | Target |
|---|---|
| `rtok-cli-darwin-arm64` | `aarch64-apple-darwin` |
| `rtok-cli-linux-x64-gnu` | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (glibc) |
| `rtok-cli-win32-x64-msvc` | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |

The table lives once, in `npm/rtok-cli/lib/platform.js`. Each platform package carries `bin/rtok`,
`bin/rtok-hook` and the `plugins/` and `skills/` trees beside them, where the binary looks.
`rtok-cli`'s postinstall (`npm/rtok-cli/install.js`) then puts the native binary in place of the launcher
on macOS and Linux, so a hook that runs `rtok` from `PATH` never starts Node (the 10 ms budget);
on Windows, or with `--ignore-scripts`, the launcher stays and runs the binary. The package is
`rtok-cli` on npm and PyPI alike; the `@rtok` scope belongs to someone else on npm, hence
unscoped `rtok-cli-<platform>` names. The versions in `npm/rtok-cli/package.json` are rewritten
from `Cargo.toml` at build time.

```bash
just npm-build                      # host: cargo build --release, pack host + rtok-cli
just npm-build --release v0.7.0     # all platforms, from the (signed) dist Release archives
just npm-publish --dry-run          # npm publish --dry-run, platform packages first
just npm-publish                    # the real thing, after `npm login`
```

`npm-build` writes `target/npm/stage/` (package trees) and `target/npm/dist/` (tarballs).
`npm-publish` refuses when a platform tarball is missing, when a tarball's name or version is not
the one in `Cargo.toml`, or when `rtok-cli`'s `optionalDependencies` point at another version.

To try the host package without a registry:

```bash
just npm-build
tmp=$(mktemp -d) && cd "$tmp" && npm init -y >/dev/null
npm i /path/to/rtok/target/npm/dist/rtok-cli-*.tgz
npx rtok --version && npx rtok --help
npm i -g --prefix "$tmp/prefix" /path/to/rtok/target/npm/dist/rtok-cli-*.tgz
"$tmp/prefix/bin/rtok" --version && "$tmp/prefix/bin/rtok-cli" --version
```

### PyPI (`rtok-cli`)

The distribution is `rtok-cli`, as on npm (`rtok` on PyPI is an unrelated tokenizer); the
command is still `rtok`. `pyproject.toml` uses maturin with `bindings = "bin"`, the ruff/uv layout: each wheel
holds the native `rtok` and `rtok-hook` as scripts. A wheel cannot ship directories beside a
script, so `plugins/` and `skills/` install to `<prefix>/share/rtok/`, which the binary checks
when it runs from `<prefix>/bin` (`src/agents/mod.rs`, `PREFIX_SHARE_DIR`). maturin and twine
run through `uvx`.

```bash
just pypi-build --sdist             # host wheel + sdist in target/pypi/dist, then twine check
just pypi-publish --dry-run         # version checks + twine check, nothing uploaded
just pypi-publish --testpypi        # upload to TestPyPI only
just pypi-publish                   # PyPI; refuses unless every platform wheel is there
```

One `pypi-build` makes one platform's wheel. Build the others on their OS (or cross from macOS
with `--target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --zig`) and collect them in `target/pypi/dist` before a
PyPI upload. Local check:

```bash
just pypi-build
uv venv /tmp/rtok-venv && VIRTUAL_ENV=/tmp/rtok-venv uv pip install target/pypi/dist/*.whl
/tmp/rtok-venv/bin/rtok --version
```

### crates.io

`tools/cargo-publish.sh` publishes every workspace crate whose `Cargo.toml` allows it, in
dependency order (one `cargo publish -p … -p …`). Today only `rtok-agent-sdk` does: `rtok`,
`rtok-plugin-sdk`, `rtok-hook`, `rtok-sys` and `rtok-wasm-demo-guest` have `publish = false`
(T23.6), and the script skips them. Every path dependency of `rtok` carries `version =`.
Publishing `rtok` itself also needs: those flags flipped (in the crates' `Cargo.toml` and in
`release-plz.toml`), a `license` on the root package, and an `exclude` for the docs site's
images — packaged as it is, `rtok` is 13.7 MiB compressed (measured 2026-09-25 with the flags
flipped locally, `cargo package --no-verify`), over crates.io's 10 MB limit.

The crate keeps the name `rtok`; it is **not** renamed to `rtok-cli` to match npm and PyPI. dist
names every release asset after the package, so a rename (tried locally, with `[lib] name =
"rtok"` so the code still builds, then `dist plan`) turns `rtok-<target>.tar.xz`,
`rtok-installer.sh`, `rtok.rb` and `rtok-<target>-update` into `rtok-cli-…`, and the app in
`dist-manifest.json` into `rtok-cli`. That breaks the installer URL in the README, the
`rtok.rb` that `pyrlyn/homebrew-tap`'s `sync-rtok.yml` downloads, the `rtok-update` that
`rtok update` runs (`src/demon.rs`) and that existing installs use to find new releases, and
release-plz's package entry. If the crate is ever published as `rtok-cli`, that needs a
decision on those names first.

```bash
just cargo-publish --dry-run        # cargo publish --dry-run for the publishable crates
just cargo-publish -p rtok-agent-sdk
```

It refuses on a dirty tree, a stale `Cargo.lock`, a path dependency without `version =` or with
one that is not the dependency's own version, a publishable crate that depends on an
unpublishable one, a crate without description or license, and a real publish of `rtok` from a
commit that is not tagged `v<version>`.

## Does this project need signing at all?

macOS refuses to run an unsigned binary only when the file carries the `com.apple.quarantine`
extended attribute, and only a quarantine-aware downloader sets it — Safari, Chrome, Mail,
AirDrop, Messages. `curl` does not, and neither does ketch.

| How someone gets rtok | Quarantined? | Unsigned binary works? |
|---|---|---|
| `curl … rtok-installer.sh \| sh` | no | yes |
| `ketch install pyrlyn/rtok` | no | yes |
| Downloads the `.tar.xz` from the Releases page in a browser | yes | **no** — "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified" |
| CI on a macOS runner (`curl`/`ketch`) | no | yes |

So the two paths the README documents already work. Signing buys you the third row, and a
`codesign -dv` that names you rather than nothing. That is the whole benefit — weigh it against
$99/year and a certificate to rotate.

## What Apple requires before any of this

1. **Apple Developer Program membership**, $99/year. There is no free tier that issues Developer ID
   certificates.
2. A **Developer ID Application** certificate. Not "Apple Development" (local runs only) and not
   "Developer ID Installer" (that one signs `.pkg` files). Create it at
   *Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Certificates → +*, uploading a CSR generated by Keychain
   Access → *Certificate Assistant → Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority*.
3. Your **Team ID** — ten characters, shown in the top-right of the developer portal.
4. For notarisation, credentials of one of two kinds. Prefer the first, especially in CI:
   - an **App Store Connect API key**: an `AuthKey_<KEYID>.p8` file, its **Key ID**, and the
     **Issuer ID** (a UUID). *Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API*. The `.p8`
     is downloadable exactly once.
   - an **Apple ID** plus an **app-specific password** from appleid.apple.com, and the Team ID.

Never commit the `.p12` or the `.p8`. They belong in the login keychain locally and in repository
secrets in CI.

## The web UI rides in the binary

The Slint WASM bundle `rtok web` serves is compiled into the executable: `build.rs` embeds
`crates/rtok-webui/pkg/` when it exists, so every install — including a ketch install that keeps
only the binary — has the UI. `.github/build-setup.yml` installs wasm-pack, runs
`tools/webui-bundle.sh --require` in each build job and exports `RTOK_WEB_EMBED=require`, so a
missing bundle fails the release instead of shipping a binary whose `rtok web` has no UI.

A bundle on disk still wins at run time (`RTOK_WEB_PKG`, `pkg/` beside the binary, the source
tree), so `just web` serves a fresh build without relinking.

A **local** `dist build` does not run that hook: build the bundle first, or the binary is built
without it.

```bash
just web-bundle
```

## Locally

Confirm the identity is installed and copy its exact name:

```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

Sign the binary. `--options runtime` (the hardened runtime) and `--timestamp` are both required for
notarisation to accept it later:

```bash
codesign --sign "Developer ID Application: YOUR NAME (TEAMID)" --options runtime --timestamp --force target/release/rtok
```

Verify the signature and read back what it claims:

```bash
codesign --verify --strict --verbose=2 target/release/rtok
```

```bash
codesign --display --verbose=4 target/release/rtok
```

Notarisation takes an archive, not a loose executable — `notarytool` accepts `.zip`, `.pkg` and
`.dmg`. Use `ditto`, not `zip`, so macOS metadata survives:

```bash
ditto -c -k --keepParent target/release/rtok rtok-notarize.zip
```

Store the API key once as a keychain profile, then submit:

```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials rtok-notary --key ~/private_keys/AuthKey_ABCD123456.p8 --key-id ABCD123456 --issuer 11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555
```

```bash
xcrun notarytool submit rtok-notarize.zip --keychain-profile rtok-notary --wait
```

`--wait` blocks until Apple answers, usually a few minutes. On `Invalid`, ask why:

```bash
xcrun notarytool log <submission-id> --keychain-profile rtok-notary
```

### Where notarisation stops short here

You cannot staple a ticket to what this project ships. `stapler` says so itself:

> Supported file formats are: UDIF disk images, code-signed executable bundles, and signed "flat"
> installer packages.

A bare Mach-O executable inside a `.tar.xz` is none of the three. The notarisation still counts —
Gatekeeper checks Apple's service online — but a first launch on a machine with no network falls
back to "unverified". If that matters, the fix is to ship a `.dmg` or a `.pkg` and staple that,
which means adding an installer format to the release, not just a signing step.

To see what a real download would do, set the quarantine attribute by hand:

```bash
xattr -w com.apple.quarantine "0081;00000000;Safari;" /tmp/rtok && /tmp/rtok --version
```

```bash
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose=4 /tmp/rtok
```

## In GitHub Actions

### Signing: dist does it, secrets are MACOS_*

`dist` signs macOS binaries when `macos-sign = true` in `dist-workspace.toml` (already on).
Regenerate the workflow after any dist config change:

```bash
just dist-generate
```

That runs `dist generate` and then [`tools/dist-generate.sh`](../tools/dist-generate.sh) patches
the generated job so it reads this repository's secrets (same names as `pyrlyn/ketch`), not the
`CODESIGN_*` names dist hard-codes:

| Repository secret | Mapped to (for dist) | What goes in it |
|---|---|---|
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE` | `CODESIGN_CERTIFICATE` | Developer ID Application `.p12`, base64-encoded |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PWD` | `CODESIGN_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | password set during that `.p12` export |
| *(none)* | `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` | discovered on the runner by [`.github/build-setup.yml`](../.github/build-setup.yml) |

`github-build-setup` points at that YAML. On macOS runners it imports the cert into a throwaway
keychain, fails the job if either `MACOS_*` secret is missing or if it cannot find exactly one
Developer ID Application identity, and exports `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` into `GITHUB_ENV` for the
subsequent `dist build` step. Do **not** duplicate the cert under `CODESIGN_*` names.

`dist generate` still warns that `CODESIGN_*` secrets are missing — it looks those names up on
the repo before the patch runs. That warning is expected here; the MACOS_* secrets are what
matter. Export and upload:

```bash
base64 -i DeveloperID.p12 | gh secret set MACOS_CERTIFICATE
```

```bash
gh secret set MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PWD
```

### Notarisation: not part of dist, add a second workflow

dist 0.32 signs but shows no sign of notarising — turning `macos-sign` on wires the signing
env (see above) and nothing else, and there is no `notarytool` step anywhere in the generated
workflow.
Do not trust a guessed config key here: dist **ignores unknown keys in `[dist]` silently**, so a
plausible-looking `macos-notarize = true` neither errors nor does anything.

Because `release.yml` is generated, notarisation belongs in its own workflow that reacts to the
finished release rather than in an edit to that file:

```yaml
name: Notarize macOS artifacts
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  notarize:
    runs-on: macos-15 # any macOS runner: notarytool ships with Xcode
    steps:
      - name: Fetch the macOS archives
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: gh release download "${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}" --repo "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" --pattern '*-apple-darwin.tar.xz'
      - name: Notarize
        env:
          APPLE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.APPLE_API_KEY_P8 }} # base64 of the .p8
          APPLE_API_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.APPLE_API_KEY_ID }}
          APPLE_API_ISSUER: ${{ secrets.APPLE_API_ISSUER }}
        run: |
          echo "$APPLE_API_KEY" | base64 --decode > /tmp/key.p8
          for archive in *-apple-darwin.tar.xz; do
            tar -xf "$archive"
            ditto -c -k --keepParent rtok "${archive%.tar.xz}.zip"
            xcrun notarytool submit "${archive%.tar.xz}.zip" \
              --key /tmp/key.p8 --key-id "$APPLE_API_KEY_ID" --issuer "$APPLE_API_ISSUER" --wait
          done
          rm -f /tmp/key.p8
```

Two things to know before adopting it. The archives are signed by the release job but their
*contents* are what gets notarised, so this submits the binary, not the tarball, and — per the
stapling limit above — nothing is stapled back; the ticket lives on Apple's side only. And the
workflow must not run before signing exists: notarisation of an unsigned or
non-hardened-runtime binary is rejected.

## Verifying a published release

```bash
curl -LsSf https://github.com/pyrlyn/rtok/releases/latest/download/rtok-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz | tar -xJ
```

```bash
codesign --display --verbose=4 rtok
```

An unsigned build answers `code object is not signed at all`. A signed one names the authority and
the Team ID.

## Status in this repository

Signing is **on**. `dist-workspace.toml` has `macos-sign = true` and
`github-build-setup = "../build-setup.yml"`. Repository secrets are `MACOS_CERTIFICATE` and
`MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PWD` (same as ketch); `just dist-generate` maps them onto the `CODESIGN_*`
names dist expects, and the build-setup step discovers `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` from the imported
cert so a third secret is not required. A macOS release job fails loudly if either `MACOS_*`
secret is missing. Notarisation is still **off** (no `APPLE_API_*` secrets); see above if that
changes.

Install paths:

- shell installer / `rtok-update` from the GitHub Release (dist)
- `ketch install pyrlyn/rtok` — in-repo [`ketch.toml`](../ketch.toml) prefers the
  `*-apple-darwin.tar.xz` / `*-linux-gnu.tar.xz` archives over `*-update` and `source.tar.gz`
- `npm i -g rtok-cli` and `uv tool install rtok-cli` — published by hand, see
  [npm, PyPI and crates.io](#npm-pypi-and-cratesio)
- `brew install pyrlyn/tap/rtok` — after `pyrlyn/homebrew-tap`'s `sync-rtok.yml` PR merges
  the `rtok.rb` Release asset (no `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` on this repo)

Regenerate the Release workflow after dist config changes:

```bash
just dist-generate
```

`RELEASE_PLZ_TOKEN` remains required; `release-plz.yml` still fails loudly without it. Dist stays
the publisher of tags and Release assets — this change only makes the signed macOS path consume
the secrets that are already set.
