# Configuration

One file, `~/.rtok/config.toml`, holds every setting rtok has. **Every CLI flag is a config
key**, so anything you can pass on the command line you can also make permanent, and
`rtok config show --sources` always tells you where a value came from.

Status: T12.1–T12.2 are done — every table below is a typed section in `config/mod.rs` (unknown
key = error), `config/default.toml` is embedded and written by `rtok config init` with each
assignment commented out, so an untouched key follows the current default;
`core.inject_budget_tokens` has moved to `plugins.inject.budget_tokens`, and layering
(user < project < env < flags, `figment`-based) plus `config show [--sources] [--json]` and
`config get <key>` are live. `config set`/`validate` and the flag-coverage test land in T12.3–T12.4.

## Precedence

Lowest to highest. Later layers override earlier ones key by key.

1. **Built-in defaults** — the values in the reference file below (`config/default.toml`,
   embedded in the binary).
2. **User file** — `~/.rtok/config.toml` (directory overridable with `RTOK_HOME`; file
   overridable with `RTOK_CONFIG=<path>` or `--config <path>`).
3. **Project file** — `<git root>/.rtok.toml`, if present. Same schema; typically only
   `[plugins.read] allow_paths`, `[plugins.cmd] rules`, `[plugins.inject] modes`.
4. **`.env` files** — `RTOK_*` lines (same names as the environment layer) from the nearest
   `.env` at or above the working directory, then `~/.rtok/.env`; the project file wins.
   Parsed only, never exported: commands run through `rtok run` do not inherit them, and other
   keys in a project's `.env` are ignored. A malformed file is reported on stderr and skipped.
5. **Environment** — `RTOK_<SECTION>_<KEY>` in upper snake case, e.g. `RTOK_PROXY_PORT=8791`,
   `RTOK_PLUGINS_CMD_REWRITE=false`, `RTOK_STATS_SINCE=7d`. Lists are comma-separated.
   Existing short names stay as aliases: `RTOK_UPSTREAM`, `RTOK_OPENAI_UPSTREAM`.
6. **Command-line flags** — `rtok proxy --port 8791`.

Rules:

- Positional per-call arguments (`hook <event>`, `expand <id>`, `run -- <cmd>`,
  `setup <host>`, `memory import <file>`, `--save-baseline <name>`) are not settings and have no key. Everything
  else does.
- Flag `--foo-bar` on subcommand `baz` ↔ key `baz.foo_bar`. Plugin settings live under
  `plugins.<id>.<key>`.
- Unknown keys are an error in `rtok config validate` and a warning (stderr, once) elsewhere.
  Hooks never fail on config problems: they log and use defaults (fail open).
- Paths accept `~`. Relative paths are relative to the file they appear in.
- Durations: `30d`, `12h`, `15m`. Sizes: plain integers in bytes or tokens as named.

## `rtok config`

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `rtok config show [--sources] [--json]` | effective config after all layers; `--sources` annotates each key with `default / user / project / env / flag` |
| `rtok config init [--force]` | write the reference file (below) to `~/.rtok/config.toml`; never overwrites without `--force` |
| `rtok config validate [path]` | parse, reject unknown keys and out-of-range values with line numbers; exit 1 on error |
| `rtok config path` | print the resolved user file path (and project file if any) |
| `rtok config get <key>` | print one effective value, e.g. `rtok config get proxy.port` |
| `rtok config set <key> <value>` | edit the user file in place, preserving comments (uses `toml_edit`) |

Credentials never print: `otel.headers` (it carries OTLP ingestion keys) shows as `<redacted>`
once set, in `show`, `get`, `set` and `rtok report` — its source still shows. Read the file itself
to see the value.

## Reference file

This is the reference with assignments shown uncommented, so each value below is the
default. `rtok config init` writes the same text with those assignments commented out;
uncomment a line to pin it. Logging is `[log]` only (D26). An old file's
`core.log_file` / `log_level` / `log_to_db` still loads once with a warning and folds into
`[log]`; `rtok config validate` rejects those keys because they are absent from the reference
schema.

### `[plugins.proxy.semantic_cache]` — opt-in response cache (P31)

Off by default until Gate P31 (zero false hits on the P9 set). When enabled (T31.2), the proxy may
serve a prior response when a normalized prompt is similar enough; a false hit is a wrong answer, so
this stays opt-in. Env: `RTOK_PLUGINS_PROXY_SEMANTIC_CACHE_ENABLED=true`.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Master switch; proxy bytes stay identical when off |
| `threshold` | `0.99` | Cosine similarity floor for the semantic tier |
| `ttl_s` | `300` | Entry TTL in seconds |
| `max_messages` | `1` | Skip cache when `messages` length exceeds this |
| `require_empty_tools` | `true` | Do not cache turns with non-empty `tools[]` |
| `embed_backend` | `"hash"` | `"hash"` = direct tier only until P29 embeddings |
| `cache_by_model` | `true` | Partition cache entries by model |
| `cache_by_provider` | `true` | Partition cache entries by provider |

```toml
[plugins.proxy.semantic_cache]
enabled = false
threshold = 0.99
ttl_s = 300
max_messages = 1
require_empty_tools = true
embed_backend = "hash"
cache_by_model = true
cache_by_provider = true
```



### `[proxy.lanes]`

Every proxied request is classified into a lane and the lane is written to the ledger
(`calls.kind`). The path decides first: Batch (`/v1/messages/batches`, `/v1/batches`,
Gemini `:batchGenerateContent`), `files`, `embeddings` and `meta` (`/v1/models`,
`count_tokens`) name their own lane. A sync chat call is an `agent` turn unless the caller
says otherwise with an `x-rtok-lane: bulk|internal` header or a `/lane/<name>/` path prefix
(`/lane/bulk/v1/messages`). Both are stripped before the request goes upstream. There are
no heuristics: an unmarked request is `agent`, the lane every request had before lanes.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | `false` records every request as a plain `api_request` and forwards the header and prefix untouched |

The agent lane keeps `calls.kind = api_request`; the others record `api_request:<lane>`
(`api_request:bulk`, `api_request:batch`, ...). Request bytes are not changed by the lane.

### `[proxy.batch]` / `[proxy.flex]` / `[proxy.routing]` — planned (see `docs/batch-flex.md`)

These three tables exist and are empty: an empty `[proxy.batch]` loads, but none has a key
yet. The keys below are the **intended** ones; adding any of them to a live config file
still fails `rtok config validate` until the matching step ships. The proxy fallback already forwards unknown paths (including `/v1/batches` and
`/v1/messages/batches`) without a `Wire`; Flex injection and routing rewrites are future
`prepare` / policy work. Full semantics: [`docs/batch-flex.md`](batch-flex.md).

#### `[proxy.batch]`

| Key | Type | Default (intended) | Meaning |
|-----|------|--------------------|---------|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Master switch; today the axum fallback always forwards Batch paths |
| `observe` | bool | `true` | Record Batch create/poll/results as distinguishable ledger rows (**planned**) |
| `parse_results` | bool | `false` | When true, parse result files/streams into `usage` rows (**planned**) |

```toml
# Planned — not loaded today
[proxy.batch]
enabled = true
observe = true
parse_results = false
```

#### `[proxy.flex]`

| Key | Type | Default (intended) | Meaning |
|-----|------|--------------------|---------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | When true, `prepare` may set OpenAI `service_tier = "flex"` if the client omitted it |
| `force` | bool | `false` | Overwrite a client-supplied `service_tier` |
| `fallback` | string | `"none"` | `none` or `default` — behaviour on Flex `429` resource-unavailable (**TODO**) |

```toml
# Planned — not loaded today
[proxy.flex]
enabled = false
force = false
fallback = "none"
```

#### `[proxy.routing]`

| Key | Type | Default (intended) | Meaning |
|-----|------|--------------------|---------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | Model / tier routing (D9); off until a policy + measurement Check exists |
| `sticky` | bool | `true` | Prefer one upstream for provider prompt-cache affinity (I-84); not Batch vs Flex |
| `default_model` | string | `""` | Empty = leave the client `model`; otherwise a fallback rewrite target |

```toml
# Planned — not loaded today
[proxy.routing]
enabled = false
sticky = true
default_model = ""
```

### Stats prices (`[stats.prices]`)

`rtok stats --price` prices the proxy `usage` rows in USD: each leg at its
`$` per MTok row, `cost` their sum, `saved` what the cache reads saved versus
uncached input price — the only saving computable from the `usage` rows alone.
A model without a row prints `-` for both dollar columns (its token counts
still print); add a dated row of your own rather than guessing. The shipped
rows were read off the providers' pricing pages on 2026-09-17 (sources in
`config/default.toml`); re-check them when your bill disagrees. `stats.price`
defaults the `--price` display on (`RTOK_STATS_PRICE=true` works too).

### WASM plugin host (`[plugins.wasm]`)

Out-of-tree `.wasm` plugins (P32, decision D6). This repo writes every catalogue plugin from
scratch and **never vendors third-party `.wasm` blobs** — operators install them under
`plugins.wasm.dir` on their machine. Default `enabled = false`: in-tree builds and the default
config do not load WASM. The Wasmi host and Cargo feature `wasm-host` land in T32.2; until then
the flag is visible in `rtok config show --sources` but has no loader.

### Graph backends (`[plugins.graph]`)

`backend = "lsp"` routes `symbol` / `callers` / `impact` / `outline` / `explore` through a
language server from `PATH` instead of the tags index. Setup walkthrough for
Rust (rust-analyzer) and Dart (Dart SDK): `docs/lsp.md`.

### Terminal output (`[ui]`)

rtok's own lines for a person at a terminal — `ok …`, `… started` / `… stopped`, `warning: …`,
`Error: …`, the `graph index` summary, `--help` — carry an emoji and a colour by default:
✅ success (green), 💡 status (cyan), ⚠️ warning (yellow), ❌ error (red).

```toml
[ui]
emoji = false   # RTOK_UI_EMOJI=false
color = false   # RTOK_UI_COLOR=false
```

- **Emoji** need `emoji = true` *and* a terminal on that stream.
- **Colour** needs `color = true` *and* a stream that takes colour: a terminal, `NO_COLOR`
  unset, `TERM` not `dumb` — or `CLICOLOR_FORCE` / `FORCE_COLOR` forcing it on a pipe.
  `color = false` also turns off the diff, state-word and log-level colours.
- What agents read never changes: hook and MCP JSON, filtered command output, `--json`, and
  anything written to a pipe or a file stay plain, byte for byte.
- `--help` colour is clap's own decision (terminal, `NO_COLOR`, `CLICOLOR_FORCE`): it prints
  before the config is read.

## TLS and corporate CAs

`rtok proxy` and OpenTelemetry export share one rustls client config: Mozilla
roots via `webpki-roots`, handed to reqwest with `use_preconfigured_tls`. They
do not use the macOS Security.framework verifier. Corporate or private CAs:
set `SSL_CERT_FILE` to a PEM bundle (curl's convention). Those certificates
extend the Mozilla set. If the variable is set, a missing, empty, or
unparsable file fails startup with the path in the error (curl parity).
Unset keeps Mozilla roots only. `rtok hook` never opens TLS.

## OpenTelemetry

`[otel]` turns on the exporter (`docs/otel.md`). Off until `endpoint` or
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` names a collector; nothing runs on the hook path.

## Mapping table (flags → keys)

| Subcommand | Flag | Key |
|-----------|------|-----|
| global | `--config <path>` | (selects the file; not a key) |
| global | `RTOK_HOME` | (selects the directory; env only, not a clap flag) |
| reading | `--json` | `stats.format` on `stats`; otherwise an action (the `web::model` page as JSON, not a stored key). On `stats`, `info`, `config show`, `doctor`, `plugins`, `agents list`, `agents sessions`, `agents whoami`, `agents show`, `agents inbox`, `worktree whoami`, `logs`, `demon status`, `otel status` |
| `hook` | `--host` | `hook.host` |
| `proxy` | `--port`, `--upstream`, `--mode`, `--dry-run` | `proxy.port`, `proxy.upstream`, `proxy.mode`, `proxy.dry_run` |
| `web` | `--host`, `--port` | `web.host`, `web.port` (`rtok dashboard` is the deprecated spelling) |
| `tui` | `--tab`, `--tick-secs` | `tui.tab`, `tui.tick_secs` |
| `stats` | `--since`, `--plugin`, `--compare`, `--calibrate`, `--cache`, `--price` | `stats.since`, `stats.format`, `stats.plugin`, `stats.baseline`, (`--calibrate`, `--cache` are actions; their knobs are `stats.calibrate_samples`), `stats.price` (`stats.prices.*` are data) |
| `report` | `--format`, `--out`, `--since`, `--ai` | `report.format`, `report.out`, `report.since`, `report.ai` (`report.budget_tokens` caps `--ai`) |
| `bench` | `--tasks`, `--runs`, `--dry-run`, `--timeout`, `--suite` | `bench.*` |
| `doctor` | `--instructions` | `doctor.instructions` |
| `agents install` | `--dry-run`, `--yes`, `--mode`, `--mcp`, `--proxy`, `--remove`, `--replace`, `--cli`, `--desktop`, `--all` | `setup.*` (`--remove`, `--replace`, `--cli`, `--desktop`, `--all` are actions) |
| `agents remove` | `--dry-run` | `setup.dry_run` (the command itself is the `--remove` action) |
| `agents list` | — | reads the host configs and `<bin> --version` (`--json` is the reading row) |
| `agents whoami` | — | reads `RTOK_AGENT_ID` and resolves it through the store (T283); no key, no `setup.*` (`--json` is the reading row) |
| `worktree whoami` | — | reads `RTOK_AGENT_ID` and `[worktree] root` (T411); no key of its own (`--json` is the reading row) |
| `task init` | `--adapter`, `--prefix` | `tasks.adapter`, `tasks.prefix`: written into the checkout's `.rtok.toml` (T441.5) |
| `task create` / `list` / `status` | `--description`, `--body-file`, `--parent`, `--status`, `--all`, `--force` | per call (no key): what one task is and which rows one call shows; `[tasks]` picks the adapter and the prefix |
| `agents usage` | `--source`, `--host`, `--since`, `--until`, `--daily` / `--monthly`, `--tz` | `agents.usage.source`, `.hosts`, `.since`, `.until`, `.period`, `.tz`, plus `.dirs.<host>` with no flag (`--unpriced` picks the view of one call, `--json` is the reading row) |
| `agents sessions` | `--all` | (action: also lists ended sessions; live vs idle follows `agents.idle`) |
| `agents show` | — | resolves an id prefix through the store (T284); live vs idle follows `agents.idle` (`--json` is the reading row) |
| `agents status` | — | writes the calling agent's (`RTOK_AGENT_ID`) status text, ≤ 120 chars (T284); no key |
| `agents send` | `--all-live` | per call (no key, no `setup.*`): one message to every live agent of the caller's project (T287); `[agents] idle` decides "live" |
| `agents inbox` | `--unread` | per call (no key, no `setup.*`): which rows one read shows (T287); `--json` is the reading row |
| `expand` | `--lines`, `--grep` (regex, literal fallback; hits print as `N:line`), `--context N` (lines around each grep hit, windows merged with `--`) | per call (no key); `expand.max_lines` caps; `expand.max_rate` is the report ceiling (T22.5) |
| `filter` | `--cmd` | `filter.cmd` |
| `config init`, `config set`, `memory import`, `graph index` | `--dry-run` | (action: renders the change as a git diff and writes nothing) |
| `memory export` | `--project` | per call (no key): narrows one dump to a project's notes |

The coverage test (T12.4) walks the clap command tree and fails if a non-positional flag
appears without a key in `config/default.toml`, so this table cannot silently drift.

## Env var examples

```bash
RTOK_PROXY_MODE=compress rtok proxy
RTOK_PLUGINS_READ_ALLOW_PATHS=/opt/src,/srv/lib rtok mcp
RTOK_PLUGINS_WASM_ENABLED=true rtok config show --sources
RTOK_STATS_SINCE=7d rtok stats
RTOK_CONFIG=./ci-config.toml rtok bench --dry-run
```

## Debug log (`RUST_LOG`)

`[log]` is the operator's log: a file with a configured level, plus `logs` rows. For debugging
there is a second, stderr-only stream behind the `log` facade and `env_logger` (T225). It is off
until `RUST_LOG` is set, so no hook, `mcp` or `proxy` run prints anything new by default:

```bash
RUST_LOG=rtok=debug rtok stats                       # argv, then every [log] line as it is written
RUST_LOG=rtok::log=info rtok proxy                   # only the mirrored [log] stream
RUST_LOG=rtok=debug RUST_LOG_STYLE=never rtok mcp    # no colour; stdout stays the MCP channel
```

The mirror ignores `[log] level`: the file keeps `info`, stderr shows what `RUST_LOG` asks for.
The variable is `RUST_LOG`, not `RTOK_LOG`: `RTOK_<SECTION>_<KEY>` names belong to the
environment layer above, and `RTOK_LOG` would collide with the `[log]` table.

`just logs [flags]` opens the file in [tailspin](https://github.com/bensadeh/tailspin) (`tspin`,
pinned in `mise.toml`), which highlights levels, dates, numbers and paths; `just logs -f` follows
it. The debug stream pipes the same way: `RUST_LOG=rtok=debug rtok stats 2>&1 >/dev/null | tspin`.

`rtok logs` and `rtok logs watch` use tailspin themselves (T225.1). With `[log] tspin = "auto"`,
the default, the numbered rows go through `tspin --print` when stdout is a terminal and `tspin`
is on `PATH`; `"always"` does so on a pipe too, `"off"` keeps rtok's own colours. Without `tspin`
the output is what it was. `rtok logs export` and `--json` never go through it.

## Why one file and not flags-only

Hooks are spawned by the host with a fixed command line; the only way to tune them is a
file. The proxy and MCP server run for hours; restarting them to change a flag is a
regression. And a bench needs two complete, reproducible configurations — which is a file
per configuration, not a shell history.

## Legacy keys

`[dashboard]` folds into `[web]` (T21.3). `core.inject_budget_tokens` folds into
`plugins.inject.budget_tokens` (T12.1). `core.log_file` / `log_level` / `log_to_db` fold into
`[log].path` / `level` / `to_db` (T24.5, D26). Each prints one warning on load and is then
dropped; `rtok config validate` rejects them because they are absent from the reference schema.

`setup.restart_prompt_timeout_seconds` is retired (T138): the post-install restart question is an
`inquire` confirm that waits for an answer (Enter, Esc or Ctrl-C mean No). A file that still sets
it gets the unknown-key warning on load and an error from `rtok config validate`.
