# `just test-changed [rev]` — build and run only the test targets the current change can reach.
#
# The suite has 41 integration targets, and `cargo nextest run` links every one of them before
# it runs a single test. Filtering with `-E` does not help: the filter is applied after the
# build. Only cargo's own target selection (`--lib`, `--test <name>`) skips the link, so this
# script's whole job is to turn a diff into that argument list.
#
# Selection, cheapest signal first:
#   tests/<name>.rs changed     -> --test <name>
#   a shared input changed      -> the whole suite (Cargo.toml, crates/, config/, justfile,
#                                  tests/common, fixtures, snapshots: too wide to map by name)
#   anything else changed       -> --lib, plus every tests/<name>.rs whose file name or body
#                                  mentions one of the changed path's segments
#
# The unit-test binary is then trimmed by name too (`-E 'kind(lib) & test(~seg)'`). Linking it is
# cheap, but running all of it is not: the TUI tests alone take ~75s of the ~76s wall clock.
#
# Markdown goes through the same name match rather than being ignored: `docs/agents.md` reaches
# the host-docs test, `plan.md` reaches the plugin-plan test, and a doc nothing asserts on
# selects nothing but the unit tests.
#
# This is an inner-loop accelerator, not a coverage proof: targets are picked by name, so a test
# that exercises a module without ever naming it is not selected. `just check` stays the gate.
#
# Usage: tools/test-changed.sh [rev]   (default rev: HEAD, i.e. the working tree)
