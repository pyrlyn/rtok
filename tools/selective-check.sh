# `just check` (T420): the gate for what this change touches. `just full-check` is the whole gate.
#
# The change is every file that differs from the merge base with main, committed or not, plus
# untracked files. It decides which `just` recipes run:
#
#   shared input (Cargo.toml, build.rs, justfile, crates/, config/, ...)  -> `just full-check`
#   Markdown, docs/, site/, .github/, brand/                              -> nothing from cargo
#   *.rs under src/ or tests/                                             -> fmt-check, lint, dup,
#                                                                            test-changed, and
#                                                                            build-min for src/
#   *.ts/*.tsx/*.js/*.mjs/*.cjs                                           -> js, dup
#   *.py                                                                  -> python, dup
#   anything else                                                         -> test-changed (by name)
#
# The test selection is the name match in tools/test-changed.sh (research.md §33 says why not
# rtok's code graph). When the merge base cannot be computed, the answer is the full gate: a gate
# that skips what it could not check would be worse than a slow one.
#
# Usage: tools/selective-check.sh        (SELECTIVE_DRY=1 prints the recipes instead of running)
# Env:   CHECK_BASE=<rev> overrides the merge base; RTOK_CHANGED (newline-separated paths)
#        replaces the git query, like in test-changed.sh.
