# rtok Codex plugin

One plugin directory for Codex (the `codex` CLI and the Codex desktop app): rtok's hooks (D21).
The layout is Codex's `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest pointing at `hooks/hooks.json`. The
plugin no longer ships an MCP server (T275/D33): `rtok agents install codex` always writes
`[mcp_servers.rtok]` into `config.toml` itself, plugin enabled or not, so there is exactly one
path to that entry instead of two copies to keep in sync.

Install:

- `rtok agents install codex` — the automated path (T140): once `codex` is on PATH it runs
  `codex plugin marketplace add pyrlyn/rtok` against this repo's root marketplace
  (`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, one entry `rtok` at `./plugins/codex`), then
  `codex plugin add rtok@rtok`, by default — no flag needed. `rtok agents remove codex` reverses
  it (`codex plugin remove rtok@rtok` then `codex plugin marketplace remove rtok`). A missing or
  failing `codex` fails open onto the file-based hooks/MCP surfaces below instead of failing the
  install.
- By hand, from a local checkout: `codex plugin marketplace add <path to this folder>` — the
  folder is also its own local marketplace (same file, one entry `rtok` at `./`) — then
  `codex plugin add rtok@rtok`. The plugin is enabled on install; Codex asks to trust its hooks
  before they run. Remove: `codex plugin remove rtok@rtok`, then
  `codex plugin marketplace remove rtok`.

The hooks resolve `rtok` from `PATH`, then `~/.ketch/bin/rtok`, else exit 0 silently (Codex only
blocks on an explicit decision) — so a hook shell whose `PATH` lacks ketch's install dir still
finds `rtok`. `commandWindows` keeps the bare `rtok hook <event>` for `cmd.exe`, which cannot run
the POSIX fallback. Install with ketch: `ketch install pyrlyn/rtok`.

While the plugin is enabled it is the only path for the compaction hooks (D21): `rtok agents
install codex` takes its own `~/.codex/hooks.json` copy back instead of adding it, so every event
fires once. `[mcp_servers.rtok]` is independent of the plugin (T275/D33) and is written on every
install/update regardless.

Files:

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — manifest (name, version, metadata, `hooks` path).
- `hooks/hooks.json` — `PreCompact` and `PostCompact`, each `timeout: 5`, resolving `rtok` from
  `PATH` then `~/.ketch/bin/rtok` (`commandWindows` bare for `cmd.exe`): the same events
  `rtok agents install codex` registers. Checked by `tests/codex_plugin.rs`.
- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` — the local marketplace that lists this folder.

Known limits:

- Only the compaction hooks. Codex's `PreToolUse` can rewrite a Bash command (`updatedInput`) and
  `PostToolUse` can add context, but rtok's handling of Codex's tool payloads has not been checked
  on a live session, so those events stay off here and in the installer until it is.
- Verified on codex-cli 0.155.1 in a scratch `CODEX_HOME` (2026-09-21): `marketplace add` accepts
  the `./` entry and `plugin add` copies the tree to `plugins/cache/rtok/rtok/0.0.1/` and enables
  it. Not verified: the hooks firing in a live session (trust prompt).
