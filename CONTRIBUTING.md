# Contributing

Repository prose is English. Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before changing
code — layout, plugin surfaces, and the fail-open / measurement invariants.

## Checks

```bash
just check
just example
just readme-check
```

SonarCloud OSS (main-branch analysis): [`docs/sonarcloud-setup.md`](docs/sonarcloud-setup.md).

Do not invent metrics or A/B wins in docs. Numbers in the README and
[`docs/comparison.md`](docs/comparison.md) must match committed evidence
(`research.md`, bench results). User guides: [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md)
and the rest of `docs/`.

## Expanded rules (from `AGENTS.md`)

- Hook contract: read `research.md` §3 before any hook task. Hook input is
  JSON on stdin, output JSON on stdout, exit 0. Exit 2 blocks (PreToolUse
  only). A hook that crashes must still exit 0.
- No new dependency without a one-line justification in the commit message.
- Code style: `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`,
  `cargo nextest run` green before every Check.
- Every new CLI flag gets a key in `config/default.toml` and a row in
  `docs/config.md` in the same commit (D12).
- No plugin shells out to, links, imports from, or reads the data of a
  third-party tool (D6).
- Graph backends: never reintroduce `lbug` / `graph-lbug` /
  `symbols_lbug.rs` / `grafeo` / `graph-grafeo` / cmake-for-liblbug. Symbol
  index is SQLite only.
- A saving that is not a `Measurement` row does not exist — in prose too:
  every number in `README.md`, `docs/` or the site cites a measured row,
  `research.md`, or a dated command, never a vendor-style claim.
- The human is the only author. No agent adds a `Co-Authored-By` trailer, a
  "Generated with …" line, or itself as author to a commit, merge, or PR.
- Host plugins (D21): `rtok agents install <host>` offers `plugins/<host>/`
  (Cursor: `rtok agents install cursor`). If `rtok` is missing, fail open and
  say to install with ketch (`ketch install pyrlyn/rtok`). Every
  `plugins/<host>/README.md` and `src/agents/<host>/README.md` has a
  `## Docs` list linking the host's current config and plugin documentation;
  re-verify links on each change (`tests/host_docs.rs`). After adding or
  changing a host or plugin surface, rerun `tests/agents_doc.rs` with
  `RTOK_BLESS=1` and commit the regenerated `docs/agents.md` table.
- New plugin: see `docs/plugin-authoring.md`.
- Parent rules: if a directory above this repository contains an `AGENTS.md`
  or `CLAUDE.md`, follow it too. On conflict with `AGENTS.md`, ask the creator.

## Models (expanded)

Low-cost (e.g. Haiku) only for docs, scans, lookups, and running commands —
never for code. Mid-tier for any code change, however small. High-performance
for research and investigation only after the user confirms — do not switch up
alone. On Cursor: grok 4.6 (no fast) for planning, refactoring, bugs;
composer 2.5 (no fast) for commands, tests, file moves, scans, web. No max
effort or fast without permission. ≤5 agents per project unless told
otherwise. Ask if unclear; write the execution plan into the `plan.md` card
before claiming. Before writing code, find the best ready library or framework
and use it; custom code only when every ready option is worse (abandoned,
heavier, poor fit) — say why in the commit message. A maintained dependency
needs no approval: add it with its one-line reason and a `toolchain.md` row;
never add an abandoned one. Prefer latest tool/package versions, but bump
already-installed ones only with the creator's permission. Rust: reuse crates
already used by sibling projects (workspace-root `rust.md`); if this repo
lacks one it should use, add it and update `toolchain.md` and `rust.md` in
the same change. Extract duplicated helpers into `packages/` via local
`{ path = "…" }`. No version bumps without permission.

## Toolchain, containers, docs

- Rust is pinned in `mise.toml`. Run everything as
  `mise exec -- cargo <cmd>` (or `mise activate` your shell). Never install
  or switch a global toolchain.
- Containers: use Colima + Docker CLI (mise pins), not Docker Desktop — see
  `docs/colima.md`.
- `README.md` and `docs/` are the public surface; `.github/workflows/sync-docs.yml`
  mirrors every `docs/**/*.md` to the landing site (pyrlyn/landing), so a repo file
  *is* the page. The README logos live in `assets/`.
- Before you start: delegate one-off shell (build, test, git, cargo),
  API/HTTP, and file listings; do not run those from the main context.

## Testing

On Windows the local gate is stricter than the Windows CI job and has a few
machine-specific traps (line endings, a dart-gated test, antivirus warm-up) — see
`docs/windows.md`.

Run tests with `just test` — the default locally and in CI (`just check`):
`-j` = logical CPUs (`--test-threads {{cpus}}`). Heavy tests (cold repo
index, 100-session memory bench, 3 000-file graph bench) run alone via
`threads-required = "num-test-threads"` in `.config/nextest.toml`; add a
matching `[[profile.default.overrides]]` there for new resource-hungry tests,
never `--test-threads=1` in the test.

Coverage: `just test-cov` runs the same suite under `cargo-llvm-cov`, writes
`coverage/lcov.info` and prints a per-file summary; nextest args pass through
(`just test-cov -E 'test(formatters)'`). Slower, so it is not part of `just check`;
CI runs it in the SonarCloud job on `main`.

Fuzzing: `fuzz/` holds cargo-fuzz (libFuzzer) targets for the CLI argv and the parsers of
untrusted input (config, rules, hook JSON, proxy bodies, JSONC edits). Nightly only and outside
the workspace, so not part of `just check`; `just fuzz` lists them, `just fuzz <target> 120`
runs one. See `fuzz/README.md`.

Unit tests for logic; integration tests (`assert_cmd`, `predicates`,
`assert_fs`, `trycmd`) for the binary, args, and output — see `plan.md` →
Reference / Working agreement.

Prefer `crate::testutil::Vfs` (in-memory path → bytes) over host `TempDir`
for unit tests that only need path/content/size. See plan D29 / T56.

Tests never touch a real agent installed on the machine (its CLI, its app bundle): use
fakes under the test `HOME` (`tests/common/agents.rs`). nextest sets `RTOK_HOST_SANDBOX`,
which hides every host outside `HOME` (T280). Real agents are for manual debugging only.

JS/TS tests (host plugins) use vitest (`vitest.config.mjs`, globals, no
`vitest` import); never `node:test`/`node:assert`. Prefer
`toMatchInlineSnapshot` for structured output. See T111. They run on Linux
only; `common::vitest` skips them on macOS and Windows.
