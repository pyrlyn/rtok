//! The rtok plugin contract: what a plugin is, the events it answers, and what it may
//! hand back to the host.
//!
//! [rtok](https://github.com/pyrlyn/rtok) reduces the tokens an AI coding agent spends, and
//! every method it uses is a plugin. This crate is the contract those plugins implement —
//! the ten that ship inside `rtok` and any written elsewhere — so a plugin author depends on
//! three small crates instead of the whole binary.
//!
//! # The rules a plugin lives by
//!
//! - **Fail open.** A hook exits 0 in ≤ 10 ms even on error, with unmodified input. A plugin
//!   that panics or blocks is a plugin that breaks the user's session.
//! - **Lossless by default.** Anything shortened stays retrievable; put the handle in
//!   [`Measurement::ref_id`].
//! - **A saving that is not a [`Measurement`] row does not exist.** Record what you changed,
//!   before and after, or it did not happen.
//!
//! # Writing one
//!
//! Implement [`Plugin`]. [`Plugin::manifest`] and [`Plugin::dashboard_page`] are required;
//! every event method has a no-op default, so a plugin writes only the surfaces it declares.
//! What the host can do for you is [`Ctx`] — estimate, record, log, your own configuration —
//! plus the capability traits in [`host`], reachable straight off `cx`.
//!
//! ```
//! use rtok_plugin_sdk::{
//!     Class, Ctx, DashboardPage, Manifest, Measurement, Plugin, PreToolDecision, PreToolUse,
//!     Surface,

//! struct Terse;
//!
//! impl Plugin for Terse {
//!     fn manifest(&self) -> Manifest {

//!     fn pre_tool(&self, ev: &PreToolUse, cx: &Ctx) -> Option<PreToolDecision> {
//!         // Fail open: every step that can be absent is a `?`, never an unwrap.
//!         let cmd = ev.tool_input.get("command")?.as_str()?;
//!         if ev.tool_name != "Bash" || !cmd.starts_with("ls -l") {

//!         }

//!             after_bytes: short.len() as u64,
//!             est_before: cx.estimate(cmd, Class::Code),
//!             est_after: cx.estimate(&short, Class::Code),
//!             ref_id: None,
//!             call_id: None,
//!         })
//!         .ok()?;
//!         Some(PreToolDecision::Rewrite {
//!             input: serde_json::json!({ "command": short }),
//!             reason: "terse: long listing is rarely what was wanted".into(),
//!         })
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! # use rtok_plugin_sdk::testing::MemoryHost;
//! let host = MemoryHost::new();
//! let ev = PreToolUse { tool_name: "Bash", tool_input: &serde_json::json!({"command": "ls -la"}) };
//! assert!(Terse.pre_tool(&ev, &Ctx::new(&host)).is_some());
//! assert_eq!(host.recorded().len(), 1);
//! ```
//!
//! [`testing::MemoryHost`] is the host in that example: it holds what a plugin records, so a
//! plugin can be tested without a database. `examples/shrink.rs` is the same shape as a file
//! you can run.
//!
//! # The events, and when the host asks
//!
//! | Method | Asked | May |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`Plugin::pre_tool`] | before a tool call runs | deny it, or rewrite its input |
//! | [`Plugin::post_tool`] | after it ran | add context beside the result, never change it |
//! | [`Plugin::session_start`] | a session starts or resumes | offer text for the context budget |
//! | [`Plugin::prompt_submit`] | a user prompt is about to go | offer text for the same budget |
//! | [`Plugin::pre_compact`] | the transcript is about to be compacted | persist state; returns nothing |
//! | [`Plugin::mcp_tools`] | the MCP server lists its tools | add tools of its own |
//! | [`Plugin::proxy_filter`] | a provider request passes the proxy | rewrite the tool results in it |
//!
//! The first four run on the hook path, where the whole dispatch has 10 ms. Offered text is
//! an [`Injection`]: the host, not the plugin, decides what fits the budget, and text that
//! changes between turns costs a cache miss on every one of them.
