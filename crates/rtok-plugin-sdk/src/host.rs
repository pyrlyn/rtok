//! What a plugin may ask the host to do.
//!
//! A plugin never sees the host's database. It sees [`Host`] — estimate, record, log, read my
//! own configuration — plus one narrow trait per area of stored state it actually uses:
//! [`Archive`], [`Notes`], [`ReadCache`], [`Ledger`], [`Symbols`]. That is the whole reason
//! this crate can be three dependencies deep while `rtok` carries SQLite, tree-sitter and a
//! web server.
//!
//! Nothing here is a general database API. A method exists because a plugin calls it; the
//! host is free to store the state any way it likes, and two of these traits (`Symbols`,
//! `ReadCache`) are caches whose contents may vanish between calls.
//!
//! Every method takes `&self` and may be called from any thread. Errors are returned, never
//! panicked: a plugin that cannot read the store still has to fail open.
