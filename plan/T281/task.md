# T281. Probe: tie a host session's hooks and its rtok MCP server to one agent

Creator request 2026-09-27 (T281–T290, D34): every agent working through rtok gets one rtok agent id, visible to the user in the terminal and to the agent over MCP. Hooks see the host's session id (`research.md` §26), but `rtok mcp` is started by the host with only `["mcp"]` and its cwd (`src/mcp.rs:592`, host from `[hook] host`); nothing today tells the MCP process which session it serves. Without that link an agent's MCP calls (`whoami`, `worktree_add`, `agent_send`) cannot be attributed to its agent id. No product code in this task.

Plan:
1. For each host with hooks and MCP (Claude Code CLI and desktop, Cursor, Codex, Copilot CLI, Grok, Gemini, Kimi, ZCode, CodeWhale): a throwaway MCP wrapper and hook script in the scratchpad (never committed) log, per process: pid, ppid chain up to the host process, cwd, every env var whose name contains `SESSION`, `CONVERSATION`, `THREAD` or the host name, MCP `initialize.params.clientInfo` and `_meta`, and the hook payload's session field.
2. Run one session per host by hand, on the creator's machine only; real agents are for manual debugging, never tests (T280). Include one sub-agent per host that has them.
3. Pick the link rule per host, in this order of preference: a session id env var the MCP process inherits (e.g. `GROK_SESSION_ID`, `GEMINI_SESSION_ID`); the nearest common host ancestor pid shared by hook processes and the MCP process; cwd + host + start time as the last resort, marked ambiguous when two sessions share a cwd.
4. Check whether one MCP process serves several sessions (the desktop apps may share one) and whether it outlives its session.

Check: `research.md` §26 gains a dated table host → host version → the MCP process's link to the session (env var name / ppid rule / cwd only / none) → sub-agent behaviour → one MCP process per session yes/no, each row with its source (the probe log or the vendor docs URL). The T283 card is updated with the rule per host.

Execution (2026-09-27): agent sessions may not read their own process environment (blocked by the host's policy), so the live runs are the creator's. (1) Worktree `_worktrees/rtok-t281`. (2) Vendor docs first, per host: which env vars an MCP server process inherits, the hook payload's session field, whether one MCP process serves one session; each fact cited with URL and date. (3) A probe kit in the scratchpad, never committed: an MCP stdio wrapper that logs pid, ppid chain, cwd, the filtered env var names and values, `initialize` params, then execs `rtok mcp`; a hook script that logs the same next to the payload's session field; a one-page run sheet for the creator. (4) `research.md` §26 gets the table from the docs now, with a "probe" column left `pending` until the creator's logs arrive; T283's card gets the rule per host once they do.

Progress (2026-10-21, `research.md` §26 "Probe status"): no new live row. The agent session's permissions blocked `ps`, `rtok agents whoami` and MCP `whoami`. The two Claude Code Probe cells now cite T473's live `ps eww` (2026-10-09): rule (a) through `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, and the desktop app's app-level server shared by every session (T455, T924). A re-run protocol is written there, built on MCP `whoami`'s `rule` field. Left: the creator's runs for the other eight hosts, then T283's card and `done.md`.
