`installed` only says a config entry exists (and today not even that, see T275). This command checks the real path: the agent starts rtok's MCP server from its own config, calls a tool, and writes the answer into its chat.

Syntax: `rtok mcp ping <agent> [--cli|--desktop] [--timeout <secs>] [--json]`. `<agent>` takes the same host names as `rtok agents install|info` (`claude`, `cursor`, `codex`, `copilot`, `gemini`, `vscode`, …); `--cli` / `--desktop` picks the variant like `agents install`; no agent means every host `agents list` shows with MCP installed. Place it in `src/cli.rs` as a `ping` subcommand of `rtok mcp`, next to `--call`. The foreign-server wrap stays behind `--` (`rtok mcp -- <argv>`), so `rtok mcp ping …` must not be parsed as a wrap argv: add a clap test for both forms. Add a matching line to `rtok agents info` help that points at it.

What it sends:
1. A new MCP tool `ping` in rtok's own server (`src/mcp`), taking `{"agent": "<display name>"}` and returning exactly `MCP <display name> жив`, where the display name is the host name `agents list` prints (for example `MCP Claude Desktop жив`, `MCP Claude Code жив`, `MCP Cursor CLI жив`). The call is logged like any MCP call, with no measurement row.
2. For hosts with a headless CLI, rtok runs the agent once with one prompt: `Call the rtok MCP tool "ping" with agent="<display name>" and reply with its result only, nothing else.` For example `claude -p …`, `codex exec …`, `cursor-agent -p …`, `copilot -p …`, `gemini -p …`. The exact non-interactive flag per host is verified against its docs and recorded in the host README.
3. For desktop-only hosts (Claude Desktop, VS Code chat, Windsurf, Zed …) there is no documented way to send a prompt from outside. rtok prints the same prompt for the user to paste into the app's chat, then does the server-side part itself: it spawns the MCP command exactly as written in that host's config (`command` / `args` / `env`), runs `initialize`, `tools/list` and `tools/call ping`, and checks the reply. That proves the configured server starts and answers, but not that the app loaded it; the output says which of the two was checked.

Success: the agent's chat reply (captured stdout for headless hosts) is exactly `MCP <display name> жив`, after trimming whitespace. Anything else is a failure: no rtok entry in the host's config, the server fails to start, the `ping` tool is missing, a timeout (default 60 s), or a different reply. Each failure prints its reason and the fix (for a missing entry, `rtok agents install <agent>`). Exit code 0 only when every checked host succeeds. `--json` prints one object per host: `agent`, `variant`, `mode` (`chat` or `server-only`), `reply`, `ok`, `reason`.

Tests: unit test for the `ping` tool reply text; clap tests for `rtok mcp ping` vs `rtok mcp -- …`; a Vfs test that the server-only check reads `command` / `args` from each host's config (rtok's entry, not a hardcoded path); an e2e that spawns `rtok mcp` through a fake host config and gets `MCP Test жив`; headless hosts are covered by a fake agent binary on PATH that runs the MCP call and echoes the result.

Check: on the creator's machine `rtok mcp ping claude --cli` prints `MCP Claude Code жив` from `claude -p`, `rtok mcp ping claude --desktop` checks the server from `claude_desktop_config.json` and prints the prompt, and after T275 both succeed; `just check`.

Execution plan:
1. `src/mcp.rs`: tool `ping`, always listed, reply `MCP <agent> жив`, logged through the existing call row (no measurement).
2. `src/cli.rs`: `ping` subcommand of `rtok mcp` beside `--call`; wrap stays behind `--`. `agents info` long help points at `rtok mcp ping`.
3. `src/mcp/ping.rs`: headless rows for claude (`-p`), codex (`exec`), cursor (`cursor-agent -p`), copilot (`-p`), gemini (`-p`), each recorded in that host README with the docs link. Every other variant is server-only: read `command` / `args` / `env` from `Agent::files`, spawn through `doctor`'s MCP round-trip (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call ping`).
4. Tests: ping reply text; clap `mcp ping` vs `mcp --`; Vfs bodies for every host's MCP shape; e2e spawn of `rtok mcp` from a fake config (`MCP Test жив`); fake `claude` on PATH.
5. Verify with `just check`.

Result: the command, the `ping` tool, the headless rows (claude, cursor, codex, copilot, gemini) with their README lines, the server-only probe from each host's config and the tests landed in #430. The creator-machine Check ran on macOS (Darwin 27.0.0) with rtok 0.17.0-alpha.3 (`0d1608a71`): `rtok mcp ping claude --cli --timeout 120` ran `claude -p` and printed `MCP Claude Code жив` (`mode` `chat`, `ok` true); `rtok mcp ping claude --desktop` spawned the `mcpServers.rtok` command from `claude_desktop_config.json`, printed the paste prompt and `Checked the configured server, not whether Claude Desktop loaded it: MCP Claude Desktop жив` (`mode` `server-only`, `ok` true). Both succeed after T275. Pasting the prompt into the Claude Desktop chat stays a manual step by design.
