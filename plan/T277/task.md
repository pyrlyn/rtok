# T277. Move rtok's MCP core into its own crate `crates/rtok-mcp`

Problem: install, update, remove, status and ping of rtok's MCP entry are written separately in each host (`register_mcp` / `unregister_mcp` / `installed` in 20+ `src/agents/<host>/mod.rs`, plus `plugin_is_mcp`, `code_serves_mcp`, `installed_mcp_only` and the MCP half of `d21_plugin_apply`). That is how the Claude Desktop entry removal (T275) was repeated on Cursor, Codex, VS Code, ZCode, Kimi, Grok, Copilot and Gemini. T275's architecture principle states the rule; this task makes it a crate boundary so a host cannot grow its own MCP logic again.

Crate layout (`crates/rtok-mcp`, workspace member, not published, no dependency on the `rtok` crate; it depends on `rtok-sys` for T276's `ProgressRunner`):
- `spec.rs`: `McpSpec` (the per-host data from T275): config path(s) per surface, format (`Json`, `Jsonc`, `Toml`), key path (`mcpServers`, `servers`, `context_servers`, `mcp.servers`, `mcp_servers`), server name, command form (bare or absolute), entry shape (`type`, `args`, `env`), duplicate-name behaviour (`Merges`, `OverridesByScope`, `Errors`, `ShowsBoth`), plugin-served name, headless ping command. `Surface { Cli, Desktop, Ide }`.
- `registry.rs`: the one list of rtok's MCP servers (today `rtok`, plus graph or plugin servers when they get their own entry): name, command, args, env. Hosts never build an entry by hand.
- `config.rs`: read and write the host config through a `Fs` trait (so the existing `Vfs` tests plug in): `write_entry`, `remove_entry`, `read_entry`, keeping unrelated keys, comments in JSONC and TOML formatting, with a backup like today.
- `status.rs`: `McpStatus { surface, entry: Present | Missing | Stale(diff), plugin_serves: Option<name> }`; the truth source for T278.
- `ping.rs`: T275.1's ping: headless run through the spec's command, or spawn the configured server and call the `ping` tool.
- `doctor.rs`: the per-host MCP check `rtok doctor` runs (entry present, command resolves, server starts, `tools/list` answers).
- `ops.rs`: `apply(spec, Mode::{Install, Update, Remove}, fs) -> Report`, the only entry point hosts call.

What moves: from `src/agents/mod.rs` the MCP read/write helpers, `installed_mcp_only`, the MCP half of `d21_plugin_apply`; from every host its `register_mcp` / `unregister_mcp` and the MCP branch of `installed`; `plugin_is_mcp` (cursor) and `code_serves_mcp` (claude); from `src/doctor.rs` the MCP probe (`spawn_mcp`, `mcp_command`, using T276's `ProgressRunner` from `crates/rtok-sys` for the spawn, so the crate never calls `Command::new` itself); the `ping` tool body for T275.1. What stays in `rtok`: hooks, proxy, plugin install via host CLIs, desktop restart, and each host's `McpSpec` value.

Migration by host:
1. Create the crate with `spec`, `registry`, `config`, `status`, `ops` and a table-driven `Vfs` test over sample specs. No host uses it yet.
2. Claude (Code and Desktop) first, because it is where T275 was found: implement its `McpSpec`, route `apply` and `installed` through `rtok_mcp::ops` / `status`, delete `code_serves_mcp`. Land with T275's fix and T278's status.
3. The hosts T275 lists as affected: Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, Codex, VS Code and Insiders, ZCode, Kimi, Grok. One commit per host, each deleting that host's MCP functions.
4. The unaffected hosts: Kilo, OpenCode, Cline, Devin, Windsurf, Zed, MiMo, CodeWhale, omp, pi, Antigravity.
5. Move `doctor`'s MCP probe and add `ping` (T275.1) on top of the crate.
6. Delete the now-empty helpers in `src/agents/mod.rs`, add a test that fails when a file under `src/agents/` touches an MCP key directly, generate the host table in `docs/agents.md` from the specs.

Check: every host's install, update, remove, status and ping pass the same table-driven test; `rg 'mcpServers|context_servers|mcp_servers' src/agents` finds only `McpSpec` values; `just check`.

Execution plan (after T275 PR A, which gives the core in `src/agents/mcp.rs`):
1. Worktree `_worktrees/rtok-T277`. PR 1: crate `crates/rtok-mcp` with `spec`, `registry`, `config` (behind an `Fs` trait the `Vfs` implements), `status`, `ops`, and the table-driven test over sample specs; `toolchain.md` row.
2. PR 2: Claude moves onto the crate; `src/agents/mcp.rs` shrinks to spec rows.
3. PRs 3-4: the other hosts, one commit per host, at most 10 files per PR.
4. PR 5: `doctor`'s MCP probe into the crate; `ping` joins when T275.1 lands.
5. PR 6: delete leftover helpers, add the guard test against MCP keys under `src/agents/`, generate the `docs/agents.md` host table.
Each PR listed here becomes a subtask (`Tn.m`, D16) when it is claimed; this card stays the epic.
Progress: PR 1 merged (#437); PR 2 (Claude Code and Desktop) done as T277.1; PR 3's strict-JSON half (Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, Kimi, VS Code) done as T277.2. Next: ZCode, Codex and Grok, then the unaffected hosts.
