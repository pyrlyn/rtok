# T275. Install/update removes rtok's MCP entry from an agent's config while a plugin serves MCP (every host)

Observed by the creator on 2026-09-27: rtok 0.10.0, Claude Code 2.1.267, `rtok@rtok` plugin installed. After `rtok agents update claude` the plugin (commit `12c7e91`) and its hooks are current, but rtok's MCP server is missing from Claude Desktop's MCP settings. It must be available in both Claude Desktop and Claude Code.

Evidence on that machine:
- `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` has no `mcpServers` key. The backup written by the same run (`_backup/claude_desktop_config.json.bak-1790511161`, 15:12) still holds `mcpServers.rtok` = `/Users/<user>/.ketch/bin/rtok mcp`, so the update removed it.
- Claude Code gets rtok's MCP only from the plugin (`.mcp.json` runs `scripts/mcp.sh`, which runs `rtok mcp`). `~/.claude.json` and `~/.claude/.mcp.json` have no `mcpServers.rtok`.
- `rtok agents info claude` still prints `✓ mcp installed` for Claude Desktop.

Cause (code on `main`, `12c7e91`). The D21 singleton rule ("while a plugin serves MCP, the config-file entry goes") is applied on every install and update, and the Claude Desktop case extends it to a different app:
- `src/agents/claude/mod.rs:724-737`, `Claude::apply` for `Kind::Desktop`: when `code_serves_mcp(cfg)` is true it calls `unregister_mcp_ours(cfg, &desktop_path(), "rtok")` instead of `register_mcp`. `Mode::Update` takes the same branch as install.
- `src/agents/claude/mod.rs:422-426`, `code_serves_mcp` is true whenever the Claude Code plugin is installed, so the desktop entry is always removed.
- T243/T244 assumed the desktop file only feeds the desktop app's Code tab. It is also the only place Claude Desktop's own chat reads MCP servers from, so removing it takes rtok out of Claude Desktop entirely.
- The read side hides it. `Claude::installed(Kind::Desktop)` (`mod.rs:688-694`) reports `mcp` when the file has `"rtok"` *or* `code_serves_mcp`. `Claude::installed(Kind::Cli)` (`mod.rs:700-706`) and most hosts below count `mcp` as installed when the plugin is present.

Hosts with the same pattern (install/update removes, or never writes, the agent-config MCP entry while a plugin serves MCP):
- Claude Desktop: `claude/mod.rs:724-737`, removes `mcpServers.rtok` from `claude_desktop_config.json` while the Claude Code plugin is installed.
- Claude Code: `claude/mod.rs:764-767`, removes `mcpServers.rtok` from `~/.claude.json` while the plugin is installed.
- Cursor: `cursor/mod.rs:113-117` with `plugin_is_mcp` (`:246`), never writes `~/.cursor/mcp.json` while the plugin is linked.
- Copilot CLI and Gemini CLI: the shared `d21_plugin_apply` (`agents/mod.rs`, the `if remove || plugin_installed(cfg)` branch), removes `mcpServers.rtok` from `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` and from Gemini's settings.
- Codex: `codex/mod.rs:334-337`, `run(cfg, true)` removes `[mcp_servers.rtok]` from `~/.codex/config.toml` while the plugin is enabled.
- VS Code and VS Code Insiders: `vscode/mod.rs:140-148`, removes `servers.rtok` from `mcp.json` while the plugin is linked (T196).
- ZCode: `zcode/mod.rs:257-260`, removes `mcp.servers.rtok` while `plugin_serves`.
- Kimi: `kimi/mod.rs:127-130` (`plugin_detected`), removes rtok's tables.
- Grok Build: `grok/mod.rs:97-101` (`plugin_detected`), removes `[mcp_servers.rtok]`.
- Not affected (MCP is written on install/update regardless of a plugin): Kilo, OpenCode, Cline, Devin, Windsurf, Zed, MiMo, CodeWhale. Check omp, pi and Antigravity (they link a plugin; verify whether their plugin serves MCP and whether their config entry is skipped) and add them here if they match.

Decision (record as a decision row; it amends D21 for MCP and replaces T271's "sweep" item and the MCP half of T243/T244):
1. Install and update always write rtok's MCP entry into each agent's own config. Only `remove` takes it out. A plugin being installed no longer suppresses or strips it.
2. Duplicates with the same name are left to the agent to merge (Claude Code merges same-name servers across scopes). All config-file entries keep the name `rtok`.
3. Where two entries could conflict by name on one surface (the agent errors or refuses on a duplicate name instead of merging), use a different name per surface, recorded in the host's README row.
4. Hooks keep the D21 singleton rule; this task changes MCP only.

Architecture principle (applies to every step below and to T275.1):
- One shared MCP core for all hosts: install, update, remove, status (`installed`), the `doctor` check and `ping` are one implementation in `src/agents/mod.rs` (or a new `src/agents/mcp.rs`), parameterised only by data: the host's config file path(s), the JSON/TOML key path (`mcpServers`, `servers`, `context_servers`, `mcp.servers`, `[mcp_servers]`), the server name(s) per surface, the command form (bare `rtok` or absolute path), and the entry shape (`type`, `args`, `env`).
- Host-specific differences live in one table, not in code branches: a per-host `McpSpec` entry (for example a `const` slice or a method on `Agent` that returns data) with those fields plus how the agent treats duplicate names (merges same-name entries, overrides by scope, errors, or shows two servers), whether a plugin also serves MCP and under what name, and the headless ping command for T275.1. `docs/agents.md` is generated from that table.
- No per-host `if plugin …` / `if kind == Desktop …` branches for MCP. The host `apply` / `installed` code calls the shared core with its spec. A new host is added by adding a table row and a Vfs test row, not new MCP logic. The per-host MCP functions this replaces (`register_mcp`, `unregister_mcp`, `plugin_is_mcp`, `code_serves_mcp`, the MCP half of `d21_plugin_apply`) are deleted once every host uses the core.
- Tests are table-driven too: one Vfs test iterates every row and runs install, update, remove, status and ping against it.

Fix:
1. For each host above, verify against the agent's docs and one real run how it treats two MCP servers named `rtok` from different sources (merge, override by scope, error, or two servers), and whether a plugin-served server is namespaced (Claude: `plugin_rtok_rtok`, so it never merges with `rtok`). Record per host in `research.md` with the agent version and a docs link. This decides where rule 3 applies.
2. Write side: change each listed `apply` so that install and update call `register_mcp` whenever `cfg.setup.mcp` is set, and `unregister_mcp` only on `Mode::Remove`. For the Claude Desktop case, drop the `code_serves_mcp` branch in `claude/mod.rs:724-737`. For Copilot and Gemini, change `d21_plugin_apply` once. Keep T246's ownership check, so a user-edited entry is left and reported.
3. Name conflicts: where step 1 shows a surface sees both a plugin server and the config entry as two servers (for example the Claude desktop Code tab, T271), give that pair distinct names or drop the plugin's MCP server (keeping its hooks) so the agent merges one `rtok`. Pick per host from step 1 and note it in the decision row.
4. Honest status: `installed()` reports `mcp` only when the agent's own config file really holds rtok's entry. Remove the `|| code_serves_mcp(cfg)` fallback in `claude/mod.rs:688-694` and the "plugin implies mcp" shortcut in the other hosts; show a plugin-served MCP as its own line (for example `✓ mcp (plugin)`) so it never stands in for the config entry.
5. `doctor`: warn per host when the agent is installed but its config has no rtok MCP entry, naming `rtok agents install <host>`. Keep T171's duplicate check only where step 1 shows the agent does not merge.
6. Tests (Vfs, no host disk, D29), for every listed host: (a) plugin installed plus `install`, then the config has rtok's MCP entry with the right command and args; (b) the same after `update`; (c) `remove` takes it out; (d) config without an entry plus the plugin, then `installed()` does not report `mcp` from the config and `doctor` warns; (e) a user-edited entry is kept with a `leave` line; (f) the T244 surface count is updated to the new rule: at most one merged rtok server per surface, or distinct names where step 3 applies. Re-bless `docs/agents.md` and each host's README MCP row with `RTOK_BLESS=1`.

Check: the tests above pass; on the creator's machine `rtok agents update claude` leaves `mcpServers.rtok` in `claude_desktop_config.json`, Claude Desktop's MCP settings list rtok, the Code tab and Claude Code list one rtok server, `rtok agents info|list` reports every host truthfully, and a Cursor/Codex/Copilot update keeps their config entries; `just check`.

Execution plan (lands before T277; T277 then moves the core into its crate):
1. Worktree `_worktrees/rtok-T275`, branch `t275-mcp-entry-always`. Research (Fix 1) per host into `research.md`, with version and docs link.
2. PR A, Claude Code and Desktop: shared MCP core in `src/agents/mcp.rs` (write/remove/status by spec), decision row amending D21, drop `code_serves_mcp` in `apply` and `installed`, Vfs tests (a)-(f) for Claude.
3. PRs B-D, the other affected hosts in groups of at most 10 files: Copilot and Gemini (`d21_plugin_apply`); Cursor, Codex, VS Code; ZCode, Kimi, Grok. Each deletes that host's MCP branch and adds its table rows to the shared Vfs test.
4. PR E: `doctor` warning (Fix 5), re-bless `docs/agents.md` and README MCP rows, then the creator-machine Check.
Progress (2026-09-28): PR A and B-D merged for Claude, Copilot, Gemini, Codex, Cursor (#444), VS Code (#455), ZCode (#459), Kimi (#467); Grok is #468. PR E merged (#483, doctor warning). Command Code, the last host that gated MCP on its plugin, is T275.2 (2026-10-11). Left: the creator-machine Check. On 2026-10-21 T275.1's `rtok mcp ping claude --cli` and `--desktop` both answered on the creator's machine (done.md).
Progress (2026-10-21, agent audit on `main` `0d1608a`): no code change needed. Every host this card lists, plus Command Code, Qwen and CodeBuddy, now writes its MCP entry on install and update behind `[setup] mcp`, whether or not a plugin is installed. Only `remove` takes the entry out. Evidence: Claude Desktop `claude/mod.rs:944-970`, Claude Code `:977-1001`, `d21_plugin_apply` `agents/mod.rs:1599-1627` (Copilot, Gemini, Qwen, CodeBuddy), Cursor `cursor/mod.rs:98-109`, VS Code `vscode/mod.rs:121-137`, ZCode `zcode/mod.rs:232-249`, Kimi `kimi/mod.rs:111-135`, Grok `grok/mod.rs:85-104`, Command Code `commandcode/mod.rs:94-102`, Codex `codex/mod.rs:360-383` (`run` takes only `remove`). `tests/singleton.rs` checks the one-server-per-surface rule. omp, pi and Antigravity were checked as the card asks; none matches (`research.md` §25 row). omp writes `mcpServers.rtok` on every install. pi has no MCP. Antigravity's plugin `mcp_config.json` is its only MCP path, and rtok writes no Antigravity config. One gap found, not fixed because it is unplanned: `plugins/devin/.mcp.json` still ships `mcpServers.rtok` beside the `mcp_config.json` entry that setup always writes, and §25 has no Devin row, so whether Devin merges the two is unknown. The creator decides if Devin follows D33. The Check did not run: this session's permissions blocked running any `rtok` binary and reading host files outside the worktree. Re-run protocol for the creator: (1) `rtok agents update claude --dry-run` shows no `- mcpServers.rtok` line, then `rtok agents update claude`; (2) `jq '.mcpServers.rtok' "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json" ~/.claude.json` prints two non-null entries; (3) Claude Desktop's Settings → Developer lists rtok, and `/mcp` in the Code tab and in `claude` lists one `rtok`; (4) `rtok agents info claude` and `rtok agents list` print `mcp` for each surface whose file holds the entry; (5) after `rtok agents update cursor`, `codex` and `copilot`, the entry is still in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml` (`[mcp_servers.rtok]`) and `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`; (6) `rtok mcp ping claude --cli` and `--desktop` succeed (T275.1). When all six pass, the card moves to `done.md`.
Each PR listed here becomes a subtask (`Tn.m`, D16) when it is claimed; this card stays the epic.
