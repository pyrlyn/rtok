# Toolchain

Project programs and direct packages from the manifests.

## Programs

| Program | How to install | Why here | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mise | brew / curl, then `mise install` | Pinned tool versions | https://github.com/jdx/mise |
| cargo-cache | mise | `just cache` / `just cache-autoclean` (T17.2); the shared cargo home fills up | https://github.com/matthiaskrgr/cargo-cache |
| cargo-nextest | global (cargo install) | Parallel test runner | https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest |
| cargo-llvm-cov | mise | `just test-cov` (T301): coverage over the nextest suite; lcov for SonarCloud | https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov |
| cargo-fuzz | global (`cargo install cargo-fuzz`) + `rustup toolchain install nightly` | `just fuzz` / `fuzz/README.md`: libFuzzer targets; nightly only for the fuzz build, the pinned toolchain is untouched | https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz |
| codeql | mise | `just codeql` (T119): local run of the code scanning in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` | https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries |
| git-cliff | mise | Changelog | https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff |
| just | mise | Command recipes | https://github.com/casey/just |
| ketch | see its README | Installs swarfr | https://github.com/pyrlyn/ketch |
| swarfr | ketch | `just test` / `just test-changed` end with a lossless cleanup of `target/` (T236) | https://github.com/listepo/swarfr |
| tailspin | mise (`ubi:bensadeh/tailspin`) | `just logs` (T225): `tspin` highlights `~/.rtok/logs/rtok.log` and the `RUST_LOG` stderr stream; a viewer, not a logger | https://github.com/bensadeh/tailspin |
| node | mise | jscpd, oxlint, oxfmt and vitest run on it; nothing in the binary does. Its `npm` packs and publishes the npm package (`just npm-build` / `just npm-publish`) | https://github.com/nodejs/node |
| gh | brew | `just npm-build --release vX.Y.Z` downloads the dist Release archives | https://github.com/cli/cli |
| uv | brew / curl | `uvx` runs maturin and twine for `just pypi-build` / `just pypi-publish`; neither is pinned in the repo | https://github.com/astral-sh/uv |
| maturin | uvx (`maturin>=1.9,<2`) | Builds the `rtok-cli` wheels (`bindings = "bin"`, pyproject.toml) and the sdist | https://github.com/PyO3/maturin |
| twine | uvx or `uv tool install twine` | `twine check` and the manual PyPI/TestPyPI upload in `tools/pypi-publish.sh` | https://github.com/pypa/twine |
| python | mise | T183: `tools/publish_marketplace` and its tests | https://github.com/python/cpython |
| pytest | mise (`pipx:pytest`) | T183: `just python` runs `tools/tests` | https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest |
| jscpd | mise | `just dup` (T26.0): copy-paste detector, config in .jscpd.json | https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd |
| oxlint | mise (`npm:oxlint`) | `just js` (T110): lint for the TS host plugins and tests/node, `--deny-warnings` | https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc |
| oxfmt | mise (`npm:oxfmt`) | `just js` / `just js-fmt` (T110): formatter for the same JS/TS files | https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc |
| vitest | mise (`npm:vitest`) | T111: runs the TS host plugin tests (`vitest.config.mjs`, globals, inline snapshots); driven by `tests/filter.rs` and `tests/pi_plugin.rs` (`--bail=1`), on Linux only (skipped on macOS and Windows) | https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest |
| vite | mise (`npm:vite`) | Peer of vitest 5 (`@vitest/mocker`); required so Windows CI can resolve `vite` when running host plugin tests | https://github.com/vitejs/vite |
| rust | mise | The one Rust version of the repo: local, ci.yml, verify.yml, sonarcloud.yml and release builds (build-setup.yml) all install it from mise.toml; `rustfmt,clippy` because CI otherwise installs the minimal profile | https://github.com/rust-lang/rust |
| rustc | mise (pin rust) | Rust compiler | https://github.com/rust-lang/rust |
| cargo | mise (pin rust) | Rust build and dependencies | https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo |
| colima | mise | Container runtime that runs Docker (and others) inside a Lima VM — lightweight alternative to Docker Desktop for agents | https://github.com/abiosoft/colima |
| lima | mise | Linux VM Colima drives; install via mise, usually started only through `colima start` | https://github.com/lima-vm/lima |
| docker-cli | mise | `docker` client; points at Colima's Docker context when Colima is running | https://github.com/docker/cli |
| docker-compose | mise | Standalone `docker-compose` against the same Colima daemon (~Docker-compatible; not Podman) | https://github.com/docker/compose |

| d3-force-3d | local | https://github.com/vasturiano/d3-force-3d | T329.13: force layout run in a web worker (`layout.worker`, 29 kB); `3d-force-graph` would simulate on the main thread, and this is the engine it uses. Last push 2025-04-09, so watch its upkeep |

| @floating-ui/react-dom | local | https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui | T414.15: positions the one chart and mark tooltip (`charts/Tooltip.tsx`); the positioning-only package, not `@floating-ui/react` |
| react-aria-components | local | https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum | T414.9: behaviour of the command palette and shortcut help (`Autocomplete`, `Menu`, `Modal`, `Dialog`): focus, keyboard, filtering, dismissal; unstyled, so the look stays on the `--pyr-*` roles. Creator decision; covers the palette, so no `cmdk` |
